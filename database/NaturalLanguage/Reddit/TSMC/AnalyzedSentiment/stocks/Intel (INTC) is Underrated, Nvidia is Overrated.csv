They have a huge disadvantage in battery life and efficiency. The only reason they hold on to market share is they spend a lot to build there moat.2- Intels stock price is like where it was 20 years ago….. when they had a technology lead!! Now they are 2-3 years behind.3- they are uncompetitive on their most profitable segment…. Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.4- profits are going to decrease tremendously…. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry….how will they compete but on cost?5- Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI? The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space…. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?6- This post makes me want to 🤢 🤮.

AMD pulled more market than them this time, but the same was true, but they did poorly for about 5 years, until the next gen hit. AMD floundered, and Intel slowly began to recover. By 2010, AMD was absolutely being crushed, and was basically a sub-tier, low end provider until this recent ordeal, which was mostly brought about by the server situation. So a company with significantly more revenues still, more skill, a new plan that is showing some fruition, and government money is just going to sink?

We are past the end of Moore's law, it's much harder to catch up when you fall behind in fab tech compared to back then.Also Intel used a lot of highly illegal cartel practices to throttle AMD's growth in the mid 2000's when Opteron servers were far better. They lost a huge lawsuit over it and also the EU fined them a billion but the damage was already done. They can't do that anymore because of how the market has changed. It's no longer Dell and HP that companies go to to buy a server that Intel could just bribe to not sell more than X number of AMD parts. Those days are long gone.more skill,More employees =/= more skilland government money is just going to sink?You realize the bill isn't just money for Intel, right? That's why its called the CHIPS Act, not the INTEL Act. The US is subsidizing their direct competitor TSMC to build a fab in Arizona. Globalfoundries (formerly AMD's fabs before they were spun off) is also receiving some of the subsidies. The total amount of money in the CHIPS Act is what TSMC spends in about 18 months on fabs. Not a magic bullet.The paradigm is not just Intel vs AMD like the early 2000s. It's Intel vs TSMC and Samsung, two mega-corporations that have a technology edge on Intel. Intel is the underdog this time around. AMD does have the infrastructure to compete, they have the node advantage over Intel afforded by TSMC.",3,nan,nan,nan
