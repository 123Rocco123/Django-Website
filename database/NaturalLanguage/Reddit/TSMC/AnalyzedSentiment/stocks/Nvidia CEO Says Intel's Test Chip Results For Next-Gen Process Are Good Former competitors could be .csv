It is in Nvidia's interest to give the Chinese government the impression that Intel is a viable foundry replacement for TSM.Because if the Chinese believe that:TSM is the only foundry capable of producing top-of-the-line GPUs.NVIDIA is prohibited from selling the cutting edge GPUs to China.Such GPUs are capable of giving the west an advantage in not just economics, but in warfare (e.g. weather system predictions), weapons (missile design and guidance), cyber warfare, or even biological warefare.Then the conclusion is that they MUST attack Taiwan soon to stop the disparity. However, if China has the impression that Intel can somewhat replace TSM (not completely but even partially), then such an attack is less attractive as it would be like cutting 3 heads off a 5 head hydra.Also, I'm sure Nvidia would love for Intel to catch up. Even though Nvidia has a terrific relationship with TSM, having more foundries closer to home (and further away from Chinese missiles) is a net gain for Nvidia.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-ceo-intel-test-chip-results-for-next-gen-process-look-good This is imo a very promising development. By making fabs with a heavier focus on porting third parties product over, Intel massively expands their TAM by joining TSMC and Samsung in selling shovels during the gold rush. Whether the Intel chips are on top, the AMD ones, or the Nvidia ones, you always need foundries, and Intel aims to be the third largest offered to third parties by 2025. If the perf/watt and cost is right, I can see former competitors hopping over, especially with early sweetheart deals to win over some consumers from TSMC which is very overbooked.",with the price hike and wafer booking situation in Tsmc. I won’t be surprised if Apple announces partnership with Intel in near future.,0,nan,nan,nan
