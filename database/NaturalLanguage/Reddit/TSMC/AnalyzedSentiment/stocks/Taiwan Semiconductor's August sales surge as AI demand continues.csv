I might have to reconsider my position as I just purchased more LEAPs / shares. I'd be surprised if they don't re-test ATHs in the next year. Their fundamentals are extremely attractive for how much upside potential they have in other areas.Either way I'd keep the shares and drop the LEAPs but was hoping to juice up my returns with additional leverage.EDIT: based on my research it looks like the suit was filed in May of 1998. MSFT almost doubled from ~$21 a share to $40 a share over the next 12 months. Then the dotcom bubble happened and they were flat for the next decade after it burst. I'd say the times are a lot different currently though.,5,nan,nan,nan

Who knows Google could split up and you could be rewarded because sometimes when a company splits the individual parts end up being worth more than the whole.

Considering the growth and p/e. Maybe you're right. Can you explain it? I tried a valuation: Looking at the historical PE they had about 30 PE in 2021, when they were about to grow their eps 33% in 12 months. Now estimates say they will grow their EPS by 29 % in the next 12 months and they have a PE of 28. To me this means they have their average valuation considering the PE and estimated growth. Of course one would normally look at the next years instead of just one year, but who really knows whats definitely going to happen in one year.
