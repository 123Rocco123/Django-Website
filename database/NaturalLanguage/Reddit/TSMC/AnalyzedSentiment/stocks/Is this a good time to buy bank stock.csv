I like TD and royal because they have huge market shares in Canada but also have been aggressively expanding into the US. TD for example is the number one bank in the greater Boston area and top 5 in NYC. BMO‚Äôs French Canadian market share is basically untouchable.

As of Q4 2022, BAC had 31% securities portfolio (Treasuries, MBS etc). SIVB which just collapsed, had 57%. These were not marked to market, and instead values reported as ""held to maturity"" (HTM). You can check out Fed's own data on Assets and Liabilities of commercial banks. There has been significant increase in deposit outflow in Feb 2023, and bank's own borrowings (bank liabilities) has steadily increased in the past 6 months. This is not a good look. Forget about hiking interest rates, staying the same for ""high and longer"" will continue to cause massive deposit outflow from banks. You are at the mercy of an unhinged Fed if you own bank stocks. The Fed's actions for the past 2 months were wrong and excessive. J Pow's most recent testimony is highly destabilizing. Insiders within the financial elites knew this, yet just today so many ""don't worry about it"" and ""no contagion"" articles were being mass produced. Caveat emptor!",0,nan,nan,nan
