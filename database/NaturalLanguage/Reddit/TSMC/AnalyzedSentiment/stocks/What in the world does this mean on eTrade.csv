,"sold some shares yesterday and today wanted to use the fund to buy others. then this popped up: Cash Account Buy Restriction Warning i only sold my share in TSMC and CIM, so not sure why that would trigger this? been on the phone waiting for a live person for over 30 mins.. figure i'd get faster response from you folks here :) TIA~","If you're in a cash account, you have to wait until the sale funds settle before you use those funds to make another purchase.You can avoid this by maintaining a margin account.",0,nan,nan,nan

What they'll do is execute the order, then warn you that you violated the rule, and if you keep doing it, they'll put restrictions on your account.So really, you should read the FINRA rules and try to avoid violating them up front, if your only option is a cash account.",4,nan,nan,nan
