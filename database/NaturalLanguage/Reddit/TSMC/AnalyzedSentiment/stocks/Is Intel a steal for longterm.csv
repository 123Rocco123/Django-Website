AMD and maybe soon NVIDIA.But they have some key technology that AMD can not offer that some data centers need. And they have contracts.Also. They own there own FAB.

Is there actual hope for a comeback from intel?,Well DC is Thier main business. And they also have other tech in there Xeon scalable prosseor line.Also don't be fooled. Having there own FAB is a big advantage. Unlike AMD and Nvidia who need TSMC to make chips for them.Also I look to IBM. They still make good income on Mainframes.Also Intel pays AMD for the 64-bit extension rights. But AMD pays Intel for X86 usage rights. (Intel tried to make its own 64 bit CPU called Itanium.. it failed miserably)Intel is a good company. They have huge government contracts. In the Milspec word. Intel has offerings in the ruggedized extreme climate sector. Think Military and NASA.This is what I know about the company. Just my opinion. Both companies need each other.For a con. Apple has dropped Intel CPUs to make there own. The M1.. NVIDIA is also about to release it's own CPU.Will NVIDIA be able to play in the server space. IDK. Getting a hyper scaler to test and certify all it's supporting hardware will play nice.. and be secure.. yet to be seen.,4,nan,nan,nan

I am scratching my head in trying to understand how are they gonna fund all their future fabs, their margins are falling and market shrinking they will have to cut dividends at least in the next couple year or take on more debt but in high interest market (higher than now) will be more expensive.They also suck on leading nodes.

Is there actual hope for a comeback from intel?,Who cares? Don’t need to make the best all the time to keep business. If that was the case then their wouldn’t be competitors.Not every one wants or needs a “Mercedes’” when they buy.People underestimate how large the economy really is and how many different needs their are. That and how many people/business have cash to spend with whoever can actually make the products they need.,2,nan,nan,nan

Is there actual hope for a comeback from intel?,Well Optane DC is not as fast as RAM. But faster then SSDs. And even seen Linus Tech Tips playing with it just a few months ago.Ya certain Larg Data set AI. Can take advantage of it. And I know there AWS has lots deployed.. it can work well with Docker and VM. As it moves the storage from across the data center on a disk shelf on another rack via. iSCIS or Fiber channel.. etc. To next to the CPU.The leg savings alone can make a huge deal. Also saves multiple translation layers..And if I am a hyper scaler with a contract with Intel already.. you know are gonna use Optane DC on there maybe ESXi/Proxmox/HyperV environment.. hell in the age of Dockers. I could load a bunch of the Dockers databases right into the Optane and use spinning rust on a disk shelf and save on SSDs. And still have a RAID 60 for solid uptime.Edit = typo correction via BOT.

Is there actual hope for a comeback from intel?,"Intel seems keen on making cpu for themselves and other people. But real value is in IP. Which doesn’t seem part of their plans.There is a huge push for intel to make CPU’s in the USA and hope it goes well, But it will take years and other companies are also doing their own plans and also buying smaller companies that provide a competitive advantage in other areas like AI, data server tech etc.It’s a big bet. It makes sense now since they fell behind and lost ground. But in 10years from now when all of that investment finally comes online, there might not need to be such emphasis in cpus and maybe it becomes a much cheaper and lower profit margins than now just like other electronics.

However they are so behind TSMC in EUV and if you remember their 14nm re-release era, I fail to see how anyone thinks they will deliver the 5 nodes in 4 years they're planning to.
