,"It just doesn't make sense for any other company to be #1. When you think about it, the economy of modern civilization is dependent on TSMC and chips only they have the tech and knowhow to make. If Apple ceased to exist it would create a gap in consumer electronics and computer market but that gap would be filled in what, 6 months, a year maybe? But if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer closed it's door tomorrow, the world would go into a decade long recession because new chips from other factories would be inferior to TSMC made. Car makers would have to halt production or make worse than previous generation vehicles, tech would stop improving. It's known that China is throwing money at this problem but it will take them years of poaching workforce from Taiwan and perfecting the tech to become what TSMC is today! When you think about it, China could start WW3 just by invading Taiwan- it's too important for USA and probably worth to start a war because of it. I feel that I overlooked something but it makes sense- the device you're typing a response to this probably has a chip made by TSMC!",Because their earnings will never be stellar due to massive R&D spending. They can’t stop spending because they have to stay ahead.I am very long TSM but they are appropriately valued at the momentedit: meant CAPEX not r&d,0,nan,nan,nan

Showing sideways performance for one or two years is a death-nail.What I am saying is: If you're going to be profitable within 24 months everyone wants a piece of the pie, but if you're going to be wildly profitable in 2025 it is hard for institutions to invest now, which is most of the money.You'd be hard-pressed to find many experts or analysts who are bearish long term on TSM (outside geo-political concerns).

Since ASML is close to being a monopoly, it can easily eat into TSMCs profits by asking for more money for their machines.ASML on the other hand has huge, and often risky, R&D expenditures.

TSMC was once the sole source for 7nm. I'm guessing that Samsung is now capable of 7nm as a second source.Also, I think, they lower the risk of a new process by asking for investments from customers like AAPL, in exchange there's lower pricing once production ramps.Also, remember some missteps. They have a dog of a process at 20nm. On 14nm, they were 3-5 years behind INTC.Bleeding edge chip manufacturing is hard sh**. Their price reflects that.",0,nan,nan,nan
