Some people mistakenly leave stop loss orders open after market close. For instance, say amazon is trading at $200. Someone leaves a stop loss at $180 in case the stock plummets at some point, to avoid extra losses from mass selling.This is normally ok for high volatility stocks like Amazon during normal market hours, but very dangerous during after or pre market hours. This is because millions of shares are traded daily and so market flunctuations are just a few cents. However, the after hours volume is super low and thus if you set up a market buy order, you are likely to fall into the next sell price at 180, which would never happen near normal market hours. Thus you plummet the stock price till the market opens up and the rest of the normal buy and sell slots are fulfilled. Remember: The price of any stock is always the price of the very last trade.So what happens there is a mistake from some people not understanding that they really shouldn't be trading after hours, unless they really know what they are doing. And it happens all the time frankly. Pretty much daily and for a lot of stocks.",0,nan,nan,nan
