That made them buy more, which created a positive-feedback loop. That pulled in even experienced traders, who saw what was up and saw the Fed pumping corporate cashflows from the credit side.It turned when the Treasury and Fed money dried up, which was between November and January.Since then it's made sense that everything is contracting as those noobs get their first taste of reality and spit out the binky. Companies are having supply chain problems and capital issues.So when the semiconductor companies, which are working off a record backlog and bringing manufacturing capacity online at record rates, start to exhibit revenue growth, that's not really nonsensical.
