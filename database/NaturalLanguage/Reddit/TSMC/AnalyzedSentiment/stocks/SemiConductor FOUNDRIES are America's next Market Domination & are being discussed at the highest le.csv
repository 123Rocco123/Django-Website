,"Tech Cold War Not as Cold as one may infer. Short and sweet: Taiwan SemiConductors (TSMC) have an impressive Fab Plant which serves the worlds leading microchip designers. They do business in all parts of the globe, up until now. TSMC are wise to the China debacle and are outright voicing that they are with U.S. They will no longer be advancing any new contracts with Huawei. This is an implicit move to show good faith to the FIVE EYES, bolstering an already tight pact with the United States. This is a promise to all TSMCs' Clients that TSMC will protect the (expensive research & development) designs via upholding customary Intellectual Property Rights. TSMC has a leading edge on its' Samsung and ARM competitors. Their process for controlling the amount of un-wanted matter pervading the nanometer construction, is unparalleled as much as their ability to manufacture any design submitted. U.S. has reciprocated and has slated construction of a new Fabrication Plant, to be headed up by TSMC, to be built in Arizona. This is a BUY and HOLD. TSMC will be at $200 April 2021 As is AMD, INTEL, Applied Materials (obviously NVDIA) P.S. If you haven't seen the youtube inside TSMC, you should. It's nearly totally automated. Machines that cover an accumulative distance of 3X around the globe, everyday. Yes, INTEL has On-Shore Fabrication Plants - But they are a ways from updating their processes to catch up to TSMC and it's an expensive overhaul not to mention some of the leaders who've made Intel what it is, have recently left. I guess they figured Moore's law has ran its course","Also, don’t forget ASML. New foundries = new EUV lithography machines, and ASML literally has a monopoly on those. They already have a backorder of 27 machines, which is crazy when you realise they normally sell about 10 each quarter. Very comfortable situation for them to be in.",0,nan,nan,nan

I believe that factory is on the highest priorities list of Trump and his council.If you don’t mind, could you private message me? I’d like to know a little more about the construction of the plant in Az. E.g. what materials are most abundantly needed to make the plant.
