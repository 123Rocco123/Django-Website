,"Intel Reaffirms: Our Discrete GPUs Will Be On Shelves in Q1 2022 there’s one little tidbit in the earnings presentation about its upcoming new discrete GPU offerings. The earnings are usually a chance to wave the flag of innovation about what’s to come, and this time around Intel is confirming that its first-generation discrete graphics with the Xe-HPG architecture will be on shelves in Q1 2022. The fundamental building block of Alchemist is the Xe Core. For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC’s N6 process to do it. Given Intel’s Q1’22 release timeframe, Intel’s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD’s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA’s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there’s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node. In conjunction with the use of TSMC’s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they’ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP. Note that this is the sum total of all of their improvements – process, logic, circuit, and architecture – so it’s not clear how much of this comes from the jump to TSMC N6 from Intel 10SF, and how much comes from other optimizations. The Q1 launch window puts CES (held the first week of January) as a good spot to say something more.

Nvidia is 81.35 P/E, AMD is 42.86 P/E.","""No new information""They just revealed earnings after market close yesterday, indicating their revenue is down due to supply shortages, and lots of capex is expected.Their capital expenditures will put pressure on their dividend, as even if they maintain solid earnings, those earnings are going right into investing in new fabs. Those may take several years to pay off, so there are short term price risks if investors sell off due to a dividend cut/suspension.I bought a lot of shares today due to the dip, I think they're a good value buy, but it's certainly not ""no new information"".",0,nan,nan,nan

,"Intel Reaffirms: Our Discrete GPUs Will Be On Shelves in Q1 2022 there’s one little tidbit in the earnings presentation about its upcoming new discrete GPU offerings. The earnings are usually a chance to wave the flag of innovation about what’s to come, and this time around Intel is confirming that its first-generation discrete graphics with the Xe-HPG architecture will be on shelves in Q1 2022. The fundamental building block of Alchemist is the Xe Core. For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC’s N6 process to do it. Given Intel’s Q1’22 release timeframe, Intel’s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD’s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA’s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there’s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node. In conjunction with the use of TSMC’s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they’ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP. Note that this is the sum total of all of their improvements – process, logic, circuit, and architecture – so it’s not clear how much of this comes from the jump to TSMC N6 from Intel 10SF, and how much comes from other optimizations. The Q1 launch window puts CES (held the first week of January) as a good spot to say something more.

Let's look at their 35 % performance over the past five years, while the rest of the market has gone up like crazy. (Divs not included.)Let's compare their debt to their cash balance and realize, that they've got about three times more debt than cash in a market relying heavily on cash. Let's look at their extreme amount of share buybacks, which is money not moving into RnD and (yes) diluting their share price as if they're living in a parallel universe. Not all buybacks are good buybacks. Intel is lagging behind with its technology.I like a good company story and sometimes do turnaround plays. Outside of this vision, there is sadly no sign on paper as to why this company should and will turn at some point other than some nebulous vision and it's brand name.I'll be buying in once the fundamentals change at least a little bit, but I'm not seeing it right now.",0,nan,nan,nan

In conjunction with the use of TSMC’s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they’ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP. Note that this is the sum total of all of their improvements – process, logic, circuit, and architecture – so it’s not clear how much of this comes from the jump to TSMC N6 from Intel 10SF, and how much comes from other optimizations. The Q1 launch window puts CES (held the first week of January) as a good spot to say something more.

,"Intel Reaffirms: Our Discrete GPUs Will Be On Shelves in Q1 2022 there’s one little tidbit in the earnings presentation about its upcoming new discrete GPU offerings. The earnings are usually a chance to wave the flag of innovation about what’s to come, and this time around Intel is confirming that its first-generation discrete graphics with the Xe-HPG architecture will be on shelves in Q1 2022. The fundamental building block of Alchemist is the Xe Core. For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC’s N6 process to do it. Given Intel’s Q1’22 release timeframe, Intel’s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD’s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA’s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there’s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node.

Their core technology is certain for death and they have been unable to break out of it. Now competitors all around them are eating their lunch - this has been known for a while. Their new leader seems great but also desperate - it's likely too late. Their foundry business will make or break them now and difference is they will be the underdog.,0,nan,nan,nan
