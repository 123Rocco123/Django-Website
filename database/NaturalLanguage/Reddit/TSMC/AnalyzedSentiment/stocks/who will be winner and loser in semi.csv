,"as we know there’s a new phase ahead in the semiconductor sector that will have major impact t the market dynamics in the semiconductor sector. NVDA result just came out. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. gaming sector down substantially. could be great value once the stock settles down. ASML will be subject to very little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly for european market. INTC is reasonably priced but i think it’s a value trap. another possible catalyst is the CHIPS act may give them a boost. TSM. fall 32% since beginning of year. Both Samsung and TSMC have 3-nm technology. it also expects to produce 2-nm in 2023. dividend yield is 2.1%. more importantly TSM owns 50% of the market and 85% of the high end. AMD - Intel’s loss of market share is AMD’s gain. higher end chip seems to be in demand really strong. biggest threat to all is the potential oversupply of chips due to government intervention.","TXN, calculators are the future",0,nan,nan,nan

The real winners are Lam Research and Applied Materials. They are guaranteed profit with expanding fab capacity. ASML is much more limited by what they are able to produce. So AMAT, KLAC, and LRCX are absolutely my most confident semiconductor plays. I like INTC too but AMAT and LRCX take the payday from expanding fab space no matter what intel's chips look like.",0,nan,nan,nan

It's very possible that NVDA or AMD could end up being this bear market's Cysco or Yahoo from 2000.My plan is to wait for the market to sort it out. I will follow the relative strength (not RSI) and let it lead me to the winners. Right now semi conductor equipment stocks are setting up nicely, ENPH, KLAC, PLAB, etc.",0,nan,nan,nan

Nvda has just been amazing, the revenue will rebound eventually. Both are good longterm holds i guess, i have more faith in nvda. I dont own neither but i will get back into nvda next month if the price is still low.I bought a bit of micron.",0,nan,nan,nan
