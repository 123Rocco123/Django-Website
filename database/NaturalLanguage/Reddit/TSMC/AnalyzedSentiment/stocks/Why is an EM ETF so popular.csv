,"On first glance, it doesnâ€™t look particularly attractive tbh. A lot of unattractive companies and the ETF itself didnâ€™t perform that good either in the young past. So why is a split between a World ETF and EM ETF so popular? Is it really and investment or is it speculation? Why just not pick a few good companies out and do it that way? Like TSMC, Samsung or whatever?","There's also a principle that EM economies are generally shit and can't create wealth.There's a few really simple reasons for this that you can learn about in development economics: rampant corruption (remember Eike Bautista?), encomienda economies (do you know which families have owned Peru for 500 years?), political turmoil (remember Oyu Tolgoi? Simandou?), and constant war (did you know the DR Congo used to be the second greatest economy of Africa?).EEM did outperform SPY 2003-2008, then slightly March 2009-2011 coming out of the crash (where EEM crashed much worse than SPY), and again slightly 2016-2018. But when it goes down it's fucking carnage, and since Jan 2010 SPY has outperformed EEM 418% to 10%.If you follow the principle of stripping out investments that hold you back, EEM should always be the first that you dump.",0,nan,nan,nan

Like TSMC, Samsung or whatever?","FRDM - Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF - is a decent alternative to traditional EM funds that doesn't get talked about much. It uses metrics like personal and economic freedom scores, avoids governments with track records of human rights violations, and various other factors to address some of the issues you mentioned.It's relatively new, having started in 2019 but has greatly outperformed EEM and even outperformed VXUS over that time. It's worth noting that TSM is currently its largest holding at 11% of the fund.",1,nan,nan,nan

Like TSMC, Samsung or whatever?","Its chart doesn't impress me, it still shows higher beta than EEM on the downside, and still its outperformance of EEM is a bit weak.I'd also wonder if its methodology would have, during the EM boom, made it pick up MELI, BABA, PBR, AMX and other such EM stocks that skyrocketed.And I have a philosophical problem with an EM fund calling Taiwan an EM, personally. But OK, it's better than EEM, and I like that it tries to address the development economics issues. Proof of concept though is always in the chart.",2,nan,nan,nan

Like TSMC, Samsung or whatever?","I think it's a little disingenuous to describe the outperformance as ""a bit weak."" Since inception, (using valueinvesting.io's site) it has generated a 9% CAGR vs EEM's 4%. That's significant outperformance. Even just looking at a 5 year stock chart (excluding dividends) EEM is up 3% vs FRDM 31%.Its max drawdown is also lower at -30% vs -36% and its worst year was -12% vs EEM's -20%. Again, that's while keeping in mind that FRDM hasn't been around very long.I doubt the fund would add names like BABA because China's government violates many of the metrics they use to determine ""investable"" markets.Ultimately I just think that for those looking to gain exposure to EMs, it could be a much better option than traditional funds like EEM. Since inception, it has also outperformed broad international funds like VXUS and developed international market funds like VEA.",3,nan,nan,nan
