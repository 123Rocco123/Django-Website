,"Taiwan’s technology protection rules prohibits Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) from producing 2-nanometer chips abroad, so the company must keep its most cutting-edge technology at home, Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo (郭智輝) said yesterday. Taiwanese law limits domestic chipmakers to producing chips abroad that are at least one generation less advanced than their fabs at home. TSMC told investors in July its next-generation A-16 chip is to enter volume production in the second half of 2026, after ramping up production of 2-nanometer chips next year. https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2024/11/08/2003826545","Anyone who pays attention knows this. TSMC is linked to Taiwan national security. Watching people think Taiwan will just outsource their silicon shield to AZ is laughable.The future of military advantage is an AI empowered advantage, and if the US wants to keep that edge they need to both go through, and protect Taiwan.

Only Intel is saying 18A is yielding “well”. No body in the industry says that. Is it 70%, 80% or 90%? “Well”, not even high, just means you’re too embarrassed of the current numbers to say it. A good tell is AVGO already rejected the 18A for their 2025 chips.It’s consensus that Intel 18A performance, Power and cost lands somewhere between TSMC N3 and N2. Intel will not have major customers in 2025 and most likely will not be able to scale and beat TSMC N2 to market. Even if Intel figures out their shit in the next 12 months it’ll be too little too late. Major customers like Apple and Nvidia will go directly to N2 in 2026. Intel will have to wait anther 4 years.",3,nan,nan,nan

No production chip will gamble on a node that’s not ready.

TSMC is going to be a year or so behind Intel in getting their new deliveries. To be clear, TSMC has a large lead and is strategically skipping being the beta tester this go round, but it's laughable to say Intel won't be delivering cutting edge chips as the only company on planet earth with the newest tools for a short time. Intel isn't going to be breaking yield records early on and has spent many billions to get to this point.
