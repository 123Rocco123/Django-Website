,Where do you think this company is going in the next decade ? It seems like Samsung is investing a lot to be the leader but that TSMC is investing even more. However we can note that Samsung might reach the 3nm sooner than TSMC.,"I have TSM because I'm from Taiwan. TSMC is super super big in Taiwan, i often joke with my friends that TSMC is basically Taiwan. Basically everyone who has buys stocks in Taiwan basically invest in TSM in some degree. I personally would recommend it. High dividend, long term grow.",0,nan,nan,nan

However we can note that Samsung might reach the 3nm sooner than TSMC.,"Tsm is huge in taiwan. Everyone there invests in it. They've got super promising tech with their 5nm> chips coming out in 2020-2021. This is really big, considering competitions working on 7nm still (mostly). With iPhone chips probably coming in near future, and potential amd collaboration (maybe confirmed already ) it's definitely a good choice. I'd go long w it but idk about it current evaluation.",0,nan,nan,nan

However we can note that Samsung might reach the 3nm sooner than TSMC.,"This business and its peers are highly cyclical. That cycle is your friend right now.But you ask: ""in the next decade"". I think that's the wrong premise. It will probably explode and implode multiple times over a decade. I'd suggest you think of it more in terms of cycle than years. Get out when the cycle turns, regardless of whether that's sooner or later in time.",0,nan,nan,nan
