,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms","Not a great article for shareholders.

The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms",They wanted Grandma's $700K,1,nan,nan,nan
,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

Intel used to be the top dog, and now they’re in a death spiral. On the grand stage of chips they’ve essentially reverted to a start up (tons of cash/availability to cash, and needing to develop a new tech/process). Inertia is massive and the company needs to shed some weight in order to start maneuvering like more of a start up if they want to stand a chance.",0,nan,nan,nan

This is what caused them to lose their market position. This was the result of bean counters hoping the cheaper process would be good enough, but while it worked the yield rates were too low causing it to become uneconomically viable and forcing intel to not shrink their chips for multiple generations to maintain economic viability.Some bug/oversight causing 13th & 14th gen chips to damage themselves slowly with overvoltage issues. They say they have it under control now with the new microcode update. Only time will tell if that is true.Mistakes INVESTORS are worried about that we don't know the outcome of yetMassive investments into new fabs without a clear roadmap, clientele, etc who will use their contracting services. This makes their balance sheet look like shit and if they don't get some big clients this will be a gigantic waste of money.Their mistakes and anti-consumer approaches are degrading a core customer base in the server sector. AMD is also going after the server market more aggressively. This puts their long term market position in jeopardy.They are making a lot of long term bets on things like GPU's that are hemmoraging money. While I believe this is probably best for them in the long term; investors want their money this quarter and these types of plays are just not what they want to see.Reasons to be optimisticTheir current chips have honestly caught up to AMD. The 14th gen that aren't killing themselves match or exceed the top AMD chips in a wide variety of tasks. 7800X3D is overall best gaming GPU but after that there is a long list of great performance/$ cpu's from intel.The 9000 series from AMD is overall a bit of a dud. VERY little benefit over the 7000 series which a large part of the 14th gen already was beating. The 7800X3D still best for consumers and while most of the benefits for the 9000 series is for servers and heavey multi-threaded workloads the jump isn't particularly impressive and well below what we normally expect for a generational leap. If 15th generation even an average boost compared to 14th gen it's VERY likely intel takes a clear lead in the market.My take. Intel is making multiple long term plays and people are getting super ancy because they have had 2 major mistakes in the last decade. These are really risky gambles with hundreds of billions of dollars and if even 1 of these turns out to be a complete failure it will be a huge issue for the company. By end of 2025 first service fabs will be online, battlemage gpu's will be out, and we will know if 15th gen is better than 9000 series or if they also stumble like AMD on this generational update.Given the massive hits in their recent stock, there likely is a lot of upside potential IF they pull it off. The idea 'they are risk adverse' to me doesn't really track with their current heavy investment strategy. The culture might be 'risk adverse' but they are playing with fire here. Messing up and having another micro-code issue is something they CAN'T afford. AMD's messups are giving them an opportunity to regain their footing and we won't know how this plays out until probably end of next year.I expect the stock to go down or stay put until we see how these bets pay off and any investment in INTEL is just betting on this stuff working out. Only project that has me super worried for them is the contract fabs. It's REALLY not clear who they would be getting contract work from. Unless they get an Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc style client I honestly DON'T know how they can justify the cost and I just don't see any of those companies leaving TSMC in a serious capacity. There just aren't many customers in the world that can even use this service and stealing them from TSMC won't be easy.",1,nan,nan,nan

,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.

This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms",Maybe the Intel Grandma guy can fill the open position.,0,nan,nan,nan

The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms","Yups, you nailed it.Intel is laying of very Sr Engineering folks (these are not your 20-25yrs frwsh college grads). They laid off Principal Architects, Chip Architects, many senior folks who were getting paid very high (over $400K) and companies try to do cost cutting rather than realizing the impact of it.Many of these folks moved to AMD, Amazon, Google and what not. I have friends who work in these positions and keep 1st hand info of where the talent is moving. Intel is drained of talent, Partners (and Customers arw worried if they buy Intel chips can Intel even provide proper support for next 5yrs). Enterprise deals are locked in for 5-10yrs and customers look at 'Sellers health as well'. First hand info coming that many customers are worried with Intel's next 7-10yr survival and if they buy $20M of chips they might get stuck.It is not about making fastest chip on the block. AMD is increasing their ER and Intel is burning cash pile super fast and customers are losing trust. Wait till Nov 2024, You might hear something big coming up in favor of AMD.Intel will just end up like Cisco, IBM, GE. A company pioneered by engineers and ruined by MBA grads, All time high for these stocks can never come again.I know America loves these companies but data and facts should not be mixed with emotions.",6,nan,nan,nan

Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms","I completely agree with this guy, I don't blame him for leaving.

To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms","This should be taken with a grain of salt. Pat Gelsinger himself was in the C-Suite position when they legendary fired 1000 managers in 2006. He has very good knowledge of internal processes and how fast Intel can get bloated, it's not the first time in this company's history. The bigger problem was once Pat came into play he was not focused on efficiency but solving the current issues with brute force. Meaning throwing as much money and people at it as possible. The issue that came into play that he slightly miscalculated how far Intel was actually behind. His famous philosophy back then was that by each generational cycle the competition came out Intel already offers 2. We can really see this in the current roadmap we're Intel comes out with new products in way under 12 months in each space. When AMD and TSMC doesn't get their act together Intel will leapfrog them in 2025. This isn't the first time Intel has done this in its history. The issue now is that Intel is a long term play and in a currently not favorable position. Wall Street does not like that. They want fast money, fast quarterly results and don't care about anything else really. Now with the recent news about activist investors iam quite sure this news is fabricated by activist investors who manipulate the media in the background to gain shareholders favor. Don't fall for it. Intel wants to protect themselves from activist investors because they would try to split the company apart for the short term gain. If they would enter Intel is done.I really hope Pat will live long enough to see how what incredible work he has done. In 2025 we will see a very competitive Intel and in 2026 current Wallstreet critics will be very very silent.Just remember the fights Jensen had with Wallstreet back then. Now they love him.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.

Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms",18a is 2nm,3,nan,nan,nan
,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker.

Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.

,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal.

The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms","You get the cheap prices when things look their worst, not when they look better. 😂",1,nan,nan,nan

Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms","If I’ve learned anything from Reddit, it’s that this negative sentiment means this stock is going to gain 100% in the next year.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction.

Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.

But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.

,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated.

Follow the AMD playbook and split the company in two. An IP engineering and design services company and a Fab company. Spin off this company or the fab company. You can unlock some value with this type of transaction. Rename the Fab company with fresh management and have a mass layoff. I think this is the only way the Fab company succeeds because Intel is not trusted any longer. Lack of trust in the industry is their core issue now.,0,nan,nan,nan

Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms",Jim does not give a f*** about politically correct corporate talk,4,nan,nan,nan

Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms",a good news to tsmc.,0,nan,nan,nan
,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence.

,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report. Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment. Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders. Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business.

Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach. This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth. Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported. Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said. To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results. The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts. Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022. To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago. Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people. Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said. Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027. An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully. Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business. Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said. Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers. https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms",Yes spend more time to defend against activist attack than to actually do some real work,0,nan,nan,nan
,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations. Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts. Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said.
