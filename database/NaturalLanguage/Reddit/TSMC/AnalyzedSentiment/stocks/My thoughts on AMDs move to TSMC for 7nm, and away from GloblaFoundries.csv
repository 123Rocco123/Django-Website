They were still buying AMD at 16 and 19 even as holders like Credit Suisse were taking profits. I think TSM is like a top 3 holding for at least one of their funds. You should subscribe to their newsletter. Their publication on AMD 7nm prior to their earnings release increased my conviction in AMD and netted me a healthy pay day in calls.,0,nan,nan,nan

Prior to the dot com burst of 99 they reached a zenith of $75.What do you think? I'm admittedly new to investing and just trying to make sound investments. AMD is currently around $25.

Crypto plays a very minor role...servers, gaming, rendering farms, consumer PCs (2018 Macbook pro 15 inch now uses AMD GPU), etc. are making the move to both the cheaper GPU and CPUs (while maintaining the same power) that AMD offers over competition. The issues with AMD stuff were that they weren't as easily integrated with other hardware as Intel.
