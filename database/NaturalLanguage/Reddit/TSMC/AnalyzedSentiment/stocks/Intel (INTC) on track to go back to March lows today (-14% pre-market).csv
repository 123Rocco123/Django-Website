,"Intel shares slumped after warning about another production delay, sparking concern the world’s largest chipmaker will fall further behind rivals in a crucial area it once dominated. At issue is a new method for cranking out smaller, more powerful chips, the timing of which “is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations”. Intel’s first 7-nanometer chips will go on sale at the end of 2022 or early 2023, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on a conference call. That’s a year behind schedule. AMD is already selling 7-nanometer-based processors. Competitive pressure has been building on Intel in recent years. The company designs and manufacturers its own processors, while many rivals focus on design and tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make their chips. That’s helped TSMC improve production faster than Intel, and given companies such as AMD a new chance to compete. With this mornings’ pre-market currently indicating opening at $52 (-14%), I’m torn on what to do with Intel. I’ve been invested in $INTC since Feb 2018, and got in around $45.
