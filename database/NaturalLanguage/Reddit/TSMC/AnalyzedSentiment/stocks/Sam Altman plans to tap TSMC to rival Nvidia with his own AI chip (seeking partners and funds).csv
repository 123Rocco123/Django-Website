More chip designers doesn’t mean they’re getting sales that need to be fabbed, or that they’re bidding higher for fab production. If a large amount of ai end buyers swap to this new company, the demand for nvidia chips simply drops proportional to the demand increase from this new company.If, however, end buyer demand spikes, buyers pay more and prices for fab space will increase as designers are incentivized to pay more.Since the fabs is the constraint here, the two levers to pull are end demand, or supply.
