Gets good grades, helps mom with errands, keeps his room clean. Has six packs under the sweater. But because of bad haircut, poor dressing sense and not playing football, girls rarely give him a second look.Then one day of summer at the beach, he takes his shirt off, wearing thin, filmsy swim shorts. BAM!! Then on, he's popular as hell.",0,0.511,POSITIVE,0.85

The Germany fab just breakground so not going to be in production anytime soon, while TW 2nm (one of them), JP, US fab are all near production ready.Also additional fab in Japan and US is on the roadmap (2nd Japan fab is said to breakground in 2025, US timeline uncertain). New advanced packaging facility in Taiwan is also on the roadmap.These all have nothing to do with the revenue jump. I think the reason is (1) some production capacity increase by re-tooling old fabs, (2) big customer migrating to newer process which is more expensive and (3) price increase due to strong demand.",1,0.553,NEGATIVE,0.994
