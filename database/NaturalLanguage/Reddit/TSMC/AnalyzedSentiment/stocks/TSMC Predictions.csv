,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis: 1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit. 2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts. 3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54. 4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed: Revenue Projection: US$26.1–$26.9 billion Gross Profit Margin: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0% Operating Profit Margin: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5% Compare this to Q3: Q3 2024 Actual Revenue: US$23.50 billion Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue: Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin: 57.8% Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin: Between 57.0% and 59.0% So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip. What do you guys think? Thanks in advance","Increased tariffs on TSMC's products will directly hurt American AI companies. I think that even if Trump doesn't realize this, his advisors do and will make him understand. Elon for example realizes that if TSMC's wafers get more expensive, so will Nvidia's GPUs that Elon wants to buy. This will directly hurt business. My hot take is that they will most likely make some sort of deal where TSMC is excempt from the tariffs on the condition that they start building factories in America, or maybe simply force Taiwan to invest in more American weapons and defence capabilities. That is what I would do at least, but what do I know? ",0,nan,nan,nan

In addition, you need very experienced people to run these factories and the Chinese wouldn’t be able to operate them without these people.The whole China invasion scare is a myth of preposterous proportions. It’s not as simple as China waltzing into a convenience store and changing management. Key suppliers would also choke off the Chinese (eg ASML, AMAT) which would add another layer of impossibility for them to “take over” TSMC. It’s just not happening.The bigger and realistic risk is China continues to be hostile to Taiwan and geopolitical tensions between China-US hurt TSMC’s financials. However this is already baked into the stock IMO. They trade at a lower multiple than other companies as strategically important as them. They sell off anytime Trump says something or the Chinese start a new round of war games. But they keep moving up eventually because they’re the only game in town. Literally no other company on the planet can replace them, which is why the whole market would tank if the Chinese got out of line.",2,nan,nan,nan

,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis: 1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit. 2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts. 3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54. 4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed: Revenue Projection: US$26.1–$26.9 billion Gross Profit Margin: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0% Operating Profit Margin: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5% Compare this to Q3: Q3 2024 Actual Revenue: US$23.50 billion Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue: Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin: 57.8% Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin: Between 57.0% and 59.0% So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip.

I want to point out during his 2024 campaign, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, which funds semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. So if he does stop portion funding to domestic production while demand for chips is still high, there will be very high public pressure to limit tariff to Taiwanese high ends chips, especially considering the executative success of tariff is uncertainty right now, but even if it is I don't think it will be heavily leveraged againts TSMC.",1,nan,nan,nan

In any event, he will have all of big tech including Musk as well lobbying him to protect TSMC. Musk knows AI better than anyone in Trump’s inner circle and you best believe he understands the consequences of hurting TSMC.Ignore the noise and remember that TSMC tripled during the first Trump term despite the pandemic and the absence of an AI boom.
