,"Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition. The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power. On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer. TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company. There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"". A lot of people may say that Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC. A shovel still has some use after a gold rush ends, an AI chip has little use after an AI rush ends. But a fab always has chips to produce, whether they're AI chips, or other purposes.","Or you go all the way down, something everyone you mentioned relies on. Asml?",0,nan,nan,nan

Take this for example.https://phys.org/news/2022-06-world-ultra-fast-photonic-processor-polarization.ampMight end up being nothing, too hard to mass produce at scale. But as someone who dabbles in physics I can tell you moving around light is much faster and more power efficient than moving around electrons. Think like a fiber internet connection vs a cable one. Super fast processors that sip power. Sounds perfect for AI no? 20 years from now that could be the new hotness with TSMC left behind because they didn’t pivot to the new tech fast enough, just like Intel last decade.Now I don’t know shit about high end process nodes and maybe this is a dead end, but point being having a patent on EUV might not mean much in 15 years. That being said I am pretty confident China is going to have a shitload of problems in the coming decades and probably won’t be at the forefront of innovation no matter what tech is on top.",5,nan,nan,nan

If you only look at headlines, though, I can see how people could come to that conclusion. Its not as talked about because its not directly in front of your face. People are chasing the quick buck because the market has turned into a veritable greedfest. Why would anyone talk about anything but Nvidia right now? But what's going on behind the scenes is exactly why Nvidia won't be able to hold onto their level of dominance or their margins. The whole industry is pushing for open source and developing open source replacements for Nvidias software stack. Once Nvidia isn't the only option, which is coming very soon, the flood gates open for an entire industry of competition. If you want an example of what happens when competition enters the market, see Tesla. You're only dominant until there's viable competition.Eventually, someone is going to do it better or a hell of a lot cheaper. In the case of AMD and Intel, they're already doing it for a hell of a lot cheaper. They offer 4x the performance per dollar over Nvidia. Only reason why Nvidia hasn't dropped yet is because the market was built on their software stack. Once the difference comes down to raw computational power is when Nvidia will start dropping like a rock. The days of Nvidia demanding a blank check are quickly approaching its end. The writing is on the wall as long as you're looking further ahead than what's directly in front of you.",5,nan,nan,nan

Yes, TFLOPs wise AMD and Intel are cheaper, but the software to use the most of the TFLOPs is limited. Nvidia for example with the 4090 gets ~82.5 TFLOPs from a google search for $1600, while the 7900 xtx gets 61 TFLOPs for around $900. That is around 1.35x the TFLOPs at 1.77x the price.Meanwhile, if you look at stable diffusion iterations per second as a straight performance number, the 4090 with Tensor optimization gets ~50-55 it/s while the 7900 xtx gets ~20it/s with ROCM / directml optimization. So 2.5x the performance for 1.77x the price. And it is a similar performance for large language models LLMs like ChatGPT, at roughly 2.5-3x the tokens per second.This doesn't get into how it is annoyingly difficult to train models with AMD hardware right now. The best solutions only work on Nvidia hardware.I say this as an AMD fanboy using a 7800xt in my computer. They are a year to two years behind Nvidia on AI performance and software. I do think Intel has better software engineers to better optimize for AI than AMD, while AMD has a pretty big hardware lead over Intel. Both are probably solid value plays long term as they reduce Nvidia's moat, but the semiconductor foundries and their enablers may rise more / be a less hyped option.",6,nan,nan,nan

The current market, our entire world economy in fact (especially here in the US) is a cataclysmic disaster in the making. Being realistic when viewing today's market, or having a logical mindset, is presently a fool's mentality. And it equally annoys and vexes me.My strategy the past few years has to invest here/there, where I see shimmer-flicker opportunities for quick gains, but for the most part sit patiently until the market takes another huge dive. The problem is.... When? Will that hit be this year? 2 years? 5? 10? I don't want to wait five years; I want the crash to be tomorrow. But why would it be? What will tank this market? There's been no threat or instability to the market since the dawn of the UK/Russian war, and that small roadblock was a predictable kneejerk reaction anyway.It's tough. Buy in now? You kidding me? At these prices? It has to come down, right? Wrong?.... There's been so much dumb money made in the market since Covid, I don't even know if money has any value anymore. But at the same time, is all that dumb money reinvested? I doubt it. And until it is, the market will climb unless there emerges from the deep dark gloom that doesn't exist an antagonist dreadsome enough to tank it. But who knows, right? That's how this game goes. You never know until it happens, and while it's happening you still don't really know. It's all hindsight observation and analysis that can never be replicated in the future.On the subject of regret, I had purchased Nvidia and Microsoft both at their lows on March 16th 2020, when Covid had tanked the market to its bottom. I picked up Nvidia around 180, near its lowest point in ages .... which I proceeded to day trade away for a measly few thousand dollar gain. My plan at the time, logically, or so I thought, was to day trade during the wild market fluctuations I was certain would occur late into 2020 as Covid pervaded the mentality of the world. I'd plan to buy it back up quickly. Problem? BAM! Market blew up like no one expected in the months following the Covid Collapse, and Nvidia rocketed higher, higher, higher... I didn't want to buy back in at those prices, *knowing* it would go down again, right? Wrong! It never went down; never has since. I've held Microsoft throughout that entire same period, which I'm up 150% on since, but Nvidia?.... That would have made me at least a cool $million. Nvidia was my day trade of choice to recover some of my Jan-March 2020 Covid losses, planning all along to buy back in permanently when the market looked to settle, but that huge NASDAQ spike no one expected following March 2020 collapse and the bubble thereafter (followed by Gamestop and all that noise in 2021)... How do you know? That's today's market! Illogical as hell. It's why so few people who are not already wealthy struggle to make fortunes themselves, I guess.What can you but keep playing? Especially when the dollar loses value daily and inflation is making whatever dollars you do have worth nickels and soon to be pennies.",2,nan,nan,nan

It's like you read my mind. What CAN you do at this point? The market has become a veritable greed fest where all the normal rules and principles have been thrown out the window. The logical side of me looks at the market and thinks it's pure insanity and I shouldn't be buying in large amounts at these high valuations. That side isn't letting me succumb to FOMO. What I need to realize is that the stock market doesn't work necessarily on fundamentals, but people's perception of the company. Had I been reading the trends instead of the fundamentals, I'd probably be up considerably more. Look at Intel for example. Reddit kids love to shit on them, but they're setting themselves up pretty freaking nicely for the future and regaining tech leadership. They hold investor events, like the one this past week, where it's announced that Microsoft and 3 other giants in the industry are buying fab space. They outlined releasing variants of the nodes on their 2025 roadmap, as well as adding 14A in 2027. What's happened to the stock since then? Nothing. I have long term conviction in the stock and have no plans on selling, as it's a retirement play, but still... I could have bought 10 grand of Nvidia stock, made a considerable upswing, sold and then bought more Intel shares.I dont know what to do at this point.

It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition.

Intel is nowhere close.Something similar to Nvidia being Apple and Amd being Samsung in terms of mobile phones.What could break this advantage is probably going to be Cloud companies (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc) who can develop open source graphics chips using ARM and other technologies.But coming back to Apple analogy, most of the end users/ AI researchers and ML engineers are accustomed to Nvidia ecosystem. Plus given the current AI craze, money is not an issue. So no one is going to cost cut to a worse platform, which could also seriously hinder innovation/productivity.Once these companies have established AI offerings, maybe then the bean counters might be able to push towards alternative solutions.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition. The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power. On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer.

But 6.8% of my portfolio is FSELX which is based on the MSCI Semiconductor index. Along with S&P 500 and other funds, they all are heavily weighted in NVDA and other semiconductor related companies.That said, I think the big returns in AI are still ahead of us. AI is big because companies will use it to transform and optimize their businesses. The business transformations of the dot.com boom weren’t the network card manufacturers. It was the companies that figured out how to create brand new markets and services using the internet as a platform. (Remember when Amazon only sold books?)The future of AI is the companies that use machine learning and deep learning to create markets and services we still cannot conceive of. Cyber defense companies and language translation businesses have an early toehold in these business models. I’m betting on the companies that can help other companies implement their AI driven vision for their business model. For example, I expect IBM to help future Amazons deploy AI driven business models. I expect Lockheed to do the same in engineering and defense.T-Mobile has already applied AI to identify customers likely to jump to other carriers and to identify ways to retain them.I also have a small position in quantum computing (QTUM etf). Quantum computing has the potential to increase the speed of processing intensive applications like AI by a few orders of magnitude.",0,nan,nan,nan
