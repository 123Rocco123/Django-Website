Not to mention AMD aren't hammering allocation anywhere near as much as last year when they were also trying to make as many playstation and Xbox SOCs as possible.Highly unlikely to be a problem. Could even just get resolved in time.,0,nan,nan,nan

Not sure why this is being downvoted this post is exactly correct. Transistor sizes on a CPU vary by what the transistor does. A given CPU has transistors of varying sizes depending on what the circuitry does. Terms like this may have had technical meaning in the past, they no longer do now. Mainly just a marketing thing.This should go without saying but CPUs are incredible complicated circuitry and comparing them is much more complicated than just measuring transistor size. Most people are not going to go through the effort to read and understand dozens of technical specifications (and to some extent fair enough!) so reducing it to a single marker is useful for marketing reasons. Yes, smaller transistors means you can pack more per square inch and better energy efficiency but it's 1 of hundreds of technical indicators that influence CPU speed/efficiency.Hell, even things like GHz ratings are extremely oversimplified as things like IPC of a given assembly instruction factor into speed as well. If processor 1 is twice the frequency of processor 2 but each instruction takes 4x as many clock cycles to run as processor 2 then the processor is not faster. And even that example is contrived.Source:https://read.nxtbook.com/ieee/spectrum/spectrum_na_august_2020/the_node_is_nonsense.html",1,nan,nan,nan
