He has invested in TSMC previously but got out because of the geopolitical risk - meaning he does see the value in foundries. But at the same time he's said he's not so keen on turnaround stories. Admittedly, I am believer in the Intel turnaround story - due to the national security angle/belief that foundry is the right play. Because of that this definitely might be wishful thinking on my part as an Intel investor, but anyone else think there might be a possibility he swoops in?",I would fucking love a senile Warren Buffett just YOLOing billions on awful investments 😆,0,nan,nan,nan

That company became Intel, the endowment made the investment (sanctioned by Buffett) and made a bundle before selling it in the early 1980s (and missing out on a subsequent several billion $ gain). Buffett never bought into it for himself. https://mixtape.swyx.io/episodes/buffett-missed-intel",0,nan,nan,nan

Further, it is a very difficult business for someone outside the business to comprehend. After it’s foundry business is spun out and it has compelling customers and revenue this part may be interesting in as soon as 5 years.",0,nan,nan,nan
