,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals. So, are semiconductors companies good long term investments? ETFs would be better than just TSM?",It's definitely a good company and a good long term investment. But the stock has been stuck for a while. They are running at 100% capacity and the demand is outstripping the supply and it will for a while. But ramping up has been eating into their profit margins so that's why the stock has been stuck in the $110-120 region for a couple of months. They recently increased their prices by 20% so the next earnings report might be pivotal in the short-medium term. They are expanding their fabs so I'm very optimistic about their long term growth.,0,nan,nan,nan

Advancing chip fabrication technology is no easy feat.Taiwan is prone to substantial flooding most years which slows down their production. Fortunately, it was announced in May of this year that TSM plan to open a chip fab factory in Arizona.I'm bullish on TSM but I'm not sure I'd be comfortable adding to it right now.
