,"I'm not saying we should be that excited about this company- I am pathetic at DD, so I'm hoping to get some guidance about where my attention should be focused to make sense of what I'm perceiving as a discrepancy. Semiconductors blew up last year, and Marvell certainly benefitted from that. Still, considering rivals like qcom, mu, avgo, and tsmc, Marvell's in it's infancy with a market cap one-third the size of the smallest of the others I listed. broadcom, for example, seems to be focusing on 5G rollout as one of their bigger growth streams, and Marvell is doing the same. Assuming they both see comparable revenue from exposure to that industry, shouldn't that result in a larger % of growth overall for marvell? Or, is there a reason to think that the already established competitors will be able to keep marvell's growth locked down due to their already substantial market share in most existing markets?",My boner is for your mom,0,nan,nan,nan

You really don’t see any of those you brought up all that much, aside from maybe TSM, even though they’re generally proven to offer great growth even with their cyclical nature.There is also a bit of an echo chamber effect, where because a lot of analysis isn’t being done collectively only the hot 5-10 stocks are continuously mentioned at any given time.Last note, TSM isn’t a rival, completely different business models from the others mentioned.",0,nan,nan,nan

You need to understand their business model and product to determine if they are competing against the industry or supplying a new one.,0,nan,nan,nan
