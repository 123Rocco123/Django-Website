,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though. Competitors This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway. AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill. With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support. Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this. There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source. Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

Its not that hard to spot but somehow a lot of people have some sort of hidden mind block that prevents them from actually researching Intel. All people talk about is CPU's and for some reason all research looks like it is based in youtube video's.The way ICT infrastructure is deployed is getting disrupted right now and Intel seems to be able to manage this change quite impressively.If a company manages to increase revenue while the industry they are dominant in gets disrupted from A to Z it shows a lot of strength. At this moment AMD is even losing market share to Intel again.Look into Intels oneapi, silicon based photonics, edge computing, etc. Those few server chips AMD manages to sell are nothing compare to what is happening with Intel.",0,nan,nan,nan

When a lot of people complain about Intel they always mention the nanometer chip. Intel does way more than just computer chips. They are involved in computer chips, self driving technology, AI development that they are now kicking up in full swing, they just got a partnership for green energy tech with Portland General Electric out west. Intel is way more involved than just computers. I bought when everyone and their mothers grandmas cousin was crapping all over this company. Now I am up over 20% currently. I really do see a long term view of this company. If you are going to comment and complain about the nanometer chip I honestly don’t want to hear it because anybody who has done proper research knows their is way more than just computer chips with this company.",1,nan,nan,nan

I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though. Competitors This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway. AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill. With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support. Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this. There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source. Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD.

Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now.

,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though.

ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though. Competitors This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway. AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill. With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support. Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this. There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source. Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee. Edit: as a final note, I'm sorry for the formatting Reddit is not great for text walls and also sorry for possible english mistakes, it's not my first language I'm not too used with posts of this lenght.","Intel along with Google and some functions of IBM are basically the last vestiges of the old ""Bell Labs"" that so many of our modern innovations came from.Like you said, Intel has its hands in so many things and people just ignore it - they talk about Nvidia AI yet they totally ignore Intel AI (Habana). They talk about autonomous driving and include Waymo and Nvidia - yet they totally ignore MobilEye even exists.It's frustrating frankly that people could have what seems to be actual hate for just a company lol. Intel does so much more than just going from 14++++++++nm to 7 nm. They are in all sorts of IoT, AI, QC, power conservation, materials science research, ADAS, etc.",1,nan,nan,nan
,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD.

,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though.

The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though. Competitors This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway. AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill. With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support. Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this. There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source. Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive.

I started with 10 shares and will try to bolster that over time. They are a historic dividend payer as well. Consensus opinion on INTC is bullish.INTC has pretty good down the board financials, pretty strong underlying fundamentals, met or beat earnings 3 straight quarters, upcoming earnings in April, so there is a strong short term growth window as well.and right now all things PC/Semiconductor/Technology are hot.I think it is a pretty safe investment with a strong growth opportunity and as a long term payer it also benefits as a portfolio hold.That is my long and short.Edit to add one thing: Intel is more than processors, but even among processors Intel gained market share against AMD this past quarter, owning nearly 81% of both the laptop and desktop market. the market share is not eroding.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC.

Right now Intel has doubled output of the high end production facilities and the competition is faced with supply- and capacity shortages.The maximum pressure has already happened and Intel is still standing and pumped up to actually engage the competition. Apart from this the whole silicon market is growing so there should be room for most if not all of the current semiconductor companies to carve out a niche and grow.Intel is just extremely cheap compared to the other companies.

Intel is probably going to be back on top this summer with their new chips in terms of overall power on the consumer end, and they have the server market locked up. There's a rumor that they will outsource to TSM for 7nm chips, but there's also a rumor that 5nm in-house production is going fine, but who knows.Intel is also entering the graphics market for real in the next couple of years, so they will be bringing someuch needed completion to that front. I don't think they will compete with Nvidia in terms of A.I and feature set, but if they're priced competitively I don't think it would be hard to dethrone AMD as the number two GPU chip manufacturer. AMD GPUs are great, but they're barebikes compared to Nvidia.Overall intel is in an interesting spot.

I suspect a transition to an ARM world would be hardest for intel considering they would be the ones with the most to lose if x86 went away.That said its not going to be a quick transition even if that ends up happening, depends a ton on software support (whether microsoft can get windows-on-arm & related dev tools up to par with apple here), but it is something to consider for a really long term play.

,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores. Pros Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them: - Management - Brand - Production issues - Competitors - Architecture & support Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment Management Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks. Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though. Competitors This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway. AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill. With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support. Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this. There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source. Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia): He previously served as CEO of VMware for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at EMC. Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of Intel, previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[2][3] Gelsinger was the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.[2] As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference Intel Developer Forum as a counterpart to Microsoft's WinHEC. In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[5] In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft.[6][7][8] Intel announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[9][1] A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Management to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[2] And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him. It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day. Brand While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone. Production issues Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand. This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits. I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though. Competitors This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway. AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill. With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support. Architecture & Support Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now. BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this. There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source. Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist. I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about. And for full disclosure even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: I do technically own some INTC but it's only 2 shares, yes 2 shares. So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first. ----------------------------------- Cons Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one: - Management - Production issues - Competitors - The x86 architecture is getting old Management I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts. It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer. Production issues Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they absolutely needed to stay competitive. Competitors If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come. Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that. The x86 architecture is getting old We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD. The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM. I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production. ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores.

Only dumb people are buying AMD and NVIDIA at current price. Dumb redditors never compare revenue to mcap.
