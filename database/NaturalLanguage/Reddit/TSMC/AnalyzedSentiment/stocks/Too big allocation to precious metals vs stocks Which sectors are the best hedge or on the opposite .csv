,"Gold and silver are considered a hedge against long term bear market / recession / war. But how about the opposite? What if i want to protect a portfolio against a long term bear / sideways trend in gold & silver with stocks? And at the same time, do not reduce PM allocation? (just add more stocks) That would rather be stocks which GENERALLY and broadly benefit from economic expansion/technology improvement, but without the specific risk associated with their market niche.... right? But heres the most difficult part. I also dont expect positive decade economically - so stocks like Walmart, Mastercard, Apple, P&G, Coca Cola... - i am not bullish on ""consumer"" stocks. I also dont like bonds or cash. My ideas as of now are: high tech stocks, mostly chip-makers: NVDA, TSMC, TXN, ASML, QCOM, AMAT software: MSFT, ORCL, C3 ai, Adobe (Adobe i guess has the strongest competition) boring , high divided , blue chip stocks, like: RIO, EPD, BHP, Vale, DLR Thoughts?","You describe VALE, BHP as boring blue chips, but they're miners. They'll likely be volatile and a play on commodities going up.If you think there will be slow growth in markets, maybe higher dividend plays are the way to go. 4-5% returns via dividend aren't bad if the market goes sideways. Miners don't always have stable dividends, so while they look attractive now, they are not always going to be like that, particularly of their produced commodities don't do well. Stable stocks are the ones you're trying to avoid, the WMT, PG etc. Basically your dividend champion stocks.I'm not sure what you're getting at as an investment thesis though. Semi conductors are consumer stocks. They go into things that consumers buy. If you think semis are going to do well, you think consumers will do well.",0,nan,nan,nan

I get it.However, regardless of consumer demand, i think companies will just use more semiconductors within their products, even when total consumer demand will be slightly down.",1,nan,nan,nan

The DXY and US 2 or 10 yr goes down, Gold usually moves higher and vice versa. In a lot of instances, Gold moves higher the same time US stocks move higher. Now the degree to which Gold outperforms traditional US stocks and vice-versa is indeed many of the examples you cited above.IF you live in the USA, the hedge against owning Gold is to own the US Dollar. So I would suggest hedging by buying Bank CD's or short term US Treasuries. You can get 13 month bank CD's yielding 4.3% or higher in a lot of banks now.",0,nan,nan,nan
