,"Citing the need to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain, Ford and GFS announced a partnership “to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the United States.” Not to be outdone, GM announced same day that it will be co-developing chips: GM will be working to develop the chips with Qualcomm Inc., STMicroelectronics NV, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Renasas Electronics Corp., ON Semiconductor Corp., NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG, Reuss said. I'm curious why these articles made no mention of Intel. If the goal is to strengthen American supply chain, wouldn't Intel be a key part of the plan? Or are these lower technology chips that's not part of Intel's key roadmap? Also, what do you guys think of these other companies that's not often mentioned here like STMSTMicroelectronics, Renasas, On Semi, NXP, and Infineon? Are they good investments? Is GFS now a buy?","There are all sorts of different chips. Intel doesn’t make them all, only a few. Similarly, AMD. NVDA. Look at ASML, the maker of the machines these companies buy to make their chips.",0,nan,nan,nan

If you don't design electronics though they're not really household names like Intel/AMD which people know about because of personal computers.A lot of the chip shortage right now is with things like power regulators made by these types of companies.",1,nan,nan,nan

I feel that I should have a semi-conductor stock in my portfolio but which one out of the many companies out there. I bought Micron in July only to be disappointed with it. I sold last week for only a 2 point advantage per share. I've been looking at Marvel Tech but then held off. I'll look at ASML because I do want a semi-conductor co which is involved with the auto industry.,1,nan,nan,nan

Call me skeptical. My gut reaction is to laugh at the concept of a ""CPU by GM."" Yeah, every few months it starts outputting the result of two plus two as five until you take it into a dealer. But, seriously, what competency does GM have with designing chips? Building a tech team for that is a long process. Look at what it took for Apple to finally move its computers over to its own CPUs. Chip design will become more and more important to automakers as Tesla has shown, but I am having a hard time envisioning GM competing in this space with Tesla.I sort of suspect this is just a bone thrown to the financial press as a way to ameliorate criticism about their culpability in the auto chip shortage.",0,nan,nan,nan

Intel's fab capacity is probably already saturated with non-processor crap they should have abandoned years ago because of the low margins.Realistically Intel isn't in that part of the sector anyway to provide passive components and low-power ARM processors. They could if they really wanted to scale out that way and definitely should break out into the ARM space as I'm certain they would do exceptionally well, but historically that hasn't been their bag. I'm not sure they'd want to give up the halo and produce low-end semiconductors, sure it would bring in more revenue but it's adulterating the brand and AMD would eat that up.I'd take a strong look at Navitas, but NXP is another I think has a lot of room to grow with the EV boom. Renesas is also a great pick, they have Apple exposure as well, but aren't married so closely like On is. ST has a lot of exposure in the computing space in general as well as general components.",0,nan,nan,nan
