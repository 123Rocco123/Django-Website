TSMC going out of business is the best possible thing to happen to Intel. The delays it would cause Intel and their clients pale in comparison to the bidding wars on intel’s fab space between companies like Apple and Nvidia. Companies will eat losses to be the only platforms left for consumers in the short term while a long term solution is found. Intel would also instantly receive a giant subsidy package to rush build all their current fabs under construction, which are meant to serve the companies new foundry model. Their new founders business is currently 2 years away from being fully operational. In an emergency that can happen a lot quicker, especially if they are guaranteed big customers lied up out the door, which will happen when the world loses 70% of its silicone fabbing capacity. The world is not just going to shrug their shoulders and quit. Companies like Intel and Samsung will reap the benefits of China invading Taiwan. Samsung has the risk of being located in the middle of this catastrophe, because an invasion of Taiwan=Dramatic increase of tension in the Korean Peninsula.

TSMC would be 100% toast from a western investor perspective. Done.Intel currently fabs parts of their chips with TSMC. Intel would for sure be hit.

Gelsinger wouldn’t be 100% unhappy that those contract could be canceled under force majure.

That’s in addition to the gains moving from 20A to the more advanced 18A node. These efficiencies are obviously incredibly important when it comes to the advancement of chip technology. Samsung and TSMC won’t have the ability utilize backside power until 2026.EUV lithography Machines- Intel bought all 5 of ASML’s 2024 machines, leaving its competitors with nothing until late 2025 at the earliest. These machines are the key to producing the most advanced chips in the world in the most efficient way possible with Intel planning on utilizing them for their 14A nodes.
