,"The 50day MA as of writing this is 75.24. AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market. If you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results. The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish. But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains. The main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was. Any additional insight from anyone would be great!",I thought low interest rates were good for stocks?,0,nan,nan,nan

Most expert sentiment is based on Fed guidance, and The Fed committing to keeping the rates at zero means A) they’re committed to inflating our way out of this and B) this current market/pandemic is going to stick around for a while. This news makes people skiddish about the market overall, and theres an abundance of uncertainty mixed with increased volatility in the next few months. The increased inflation will eventually bite us in the ass it’s just unclear how/when and with tax laws potentially changing after the election many big players will want to cash out now.Personally, I think the volatility presents a lot of great buy and hold opportunities if you can stomach some drops in the meantime.

But it reinforces certain current trends, such as its cheaper to borrow money than sell bonds or equivalents.At the current borrowing rate, why would anyone do anything but trust equities markets? I see real estate, commodities and equities continuing to surge as long as interest rates (or the risk free rate) is near zero.The moment interest rates get to 2%, this all starts to crumble as people will move out of high speculative, overvalued stocks to more reliable 2% gains from bonds/treasuries again. But as long as treasuries and bonds continue to offer < 1% return, you're losing money to inflation by not putting it into the market.I agree this is a bear trap.

It literally makes no sense. And I don't want to hear ""it's a growth story."" Yes, that's true, but it's also all baked in by this point if that's the case. If you're buying into AMD at this level, you're basically saying to yourself that you expect AMD to grow profits by 14x from $700M to $10B just to match Intel on a comparable basis. And then the price would be fair and you'd have no logical upside. That's a massive ""What If"". Either Intel's profit is somehow less valuable, or AMD is vastly overpriced.Don't get me wrong, I love AMD as a company and the products they produce. I have an AMD processor as part of my last upgrade. But the stock has gotten out of control. It just doesn't make sense anymore, so I sold in the 80s. I will look to start re-buying in the 50s because if $73 breaks, it's a long way down until the next area of support.",0,nan,nan,nan

Its priced so high right now, that there's not a lot of place for it to go without major new innovations or going into new markets. Like you said, INTC is more than just semiconductors, and its annual revenue is 35x that of AMD. AMD is just a darling recently because of the wonky nature of our market.I agree with you that the biggest threat right now is the stock falling all the way through support at $70 into the $50's, where it was in May/June.But honestly, the entire market feels like its about to do that. SPY is testing 3300, and if it doesn't support, there could be a big selloff right to the bottom.I don't plan to buy more (I'm already underwater on AMD as I bought in in the 80's range). If it falls all the way down into the 50's, I may DCA then, and try to recoup my losses on a hail mary back into the 70's.Maybe I made the wrong play here, but its hard to consider fundamentals when almost every since you stock you compare AMD to has even worst P/E levels.Value stocks have been absolutely manhandled in the past 5 years, maybe even past 10 years. At some point things have to rotate back into value. But as long as interest rates are zero, and macro industry factors are into ""innovation"", I see AMD's valuation being irrationally high without justification.Stocks go up, stocks go down.

I had some savings left and everyone was telling me don't do it, don't invest anywhere and I felt saving accounts weren't giving me anything. So started doing research because at that time AMD had been in a lawsuit for anti-competitiveness with Intel paying manufacturers to use their product over AMD( I think the settlement was like $4 billion) but don't recall. When the crash happened they tumbled along with a couple of other ones, like Sony and Microsoft. So during the crash I had picked up AMD (my starting costs were at 1.25 or 1.26, if i recall correctly). Then I started buying more as i started working during school. Later on my research found that they were being used in gaming systems. So I decided to start buying more and at one my highest point, I had like 40k shares, but now wish I had held on to it all. With that being said, I started buying more AMD during 2009 to 2015, I also started buying SNE (15-17/share) and MSFT around 22/share but sold them off. But i had a feeling that they would be coming back up because their core business is not really consumer as it is innovation and businesses. An example is Sony camera's are in most smart phones.So some of it was luck and some of it was understand and predicting that their business model will pay off because I like to always invest for the long run, and don't care much for the short-term.",4,nan,nan,nan

,"The 50day MA as of writing this is 75.24. AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market. If you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results. The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish. But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains. The main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was. Any additional insight from anyone would be great!",The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30So like a month and a half...,0,nan,nan,nan

The competitor now owns ARM with all its licenses!,0,nan,nan,nan
