,"[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link] I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor. So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same. Positions: AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.","Valid points. I think the biggest risk though is the current valuation. Even if Amd continues to grow at 50% yoy, there’s not much money to be made in the mid/long term when you assume that stocks tend to return to a valuation of 20-25, maybe 30-35 in this low-interest-rate environment. Doesn’t this basically mean that Amd, if it continues this growth rate, should have the same valuation in 3-5 years that it has now?Also, iirc Amd has given out lots of shares over the last years which also will be a pressure on stock price of continued.",0,nan,nan,nan

However, I think many ""long AMD"" ppl aren't aware of that and simply assume that stock price growth will match revenue growth. I just wanted to point out that there's an end to that.

Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same. Positions: AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.","Valid points well. But you have to take into account that these markets are increasing as well. Especially in the current lockdowns. Record demand in laptops, data centers etc. And there is still market share to be gained from competitors. Intel and NVDA trade at 200B and 320B valuation I believe, AMD is 'still' at 90B. I am not saying this stock is going x10 soon. But the way they are positions it could easily reach 150-250B valuation.",1,nan,nan,nan

This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update.

,"[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link] I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor. So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards.

So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same. Positions: AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.",I though I was so fucking smart when I bought it at $2 sold it at $4.,1,nan,nan,nan

However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update.

,"[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link] I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor. So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment.

Oh boy they were wrong when SP was at $2 and they are still wrong when SP is around $75. Remember due to Intel process woes they will continue to lag behind certainly till 2023. AMD has 10% of data center market share and around 20% in desktop and notebooks- no way near saturation. AMD will continue to grab market share at Intel expense.Coming to GPUs. LOL what can I say? It just took one attempt to match or surpass NVIDIA and people were very pessimistic about GPU prospects. AMD has <10% of dedicated laptop market and around 25-30% of desktop market. Coming to data center (growing rapidly) I think its fair to say its below 5% if you compare against NVIDIA.NVIDIA is going to feel the pain now just like Intel. Jensen is already sweating in his leather jacket. News of NVIDIA testing and cancelling of various Ampere SKUs is all over Twitter. First 3080 20GB and 3070 16GB then 3070Ti. NVIDIA is poised to lose big chunk of market share especially in the stronghold notebook space as Ampere perf/watt is worse than RDNA2 and with superior efficiency of Ryzen 4000 and upcoming 5000 APU, AMD Ryzen+Radeon combo will sell like hot cakes in comparison to power hog Intel Skylake and Ampere.Regarding Xilinx deal, shorts have no clue. If the deal closes, AMD will become a computing powerhouse with presence in 5G, automotive, AI, IOT, networking. Coming to dilution as they always bring, this dilution will bring $3b in annual revenue and $1b in profit at 70% margins.Pessimistic can sell and shorts can short. AMD has long term growth prospects. Long AMD since 2016.Also noticed, NVIDIA’s fan Jim Cramer now holds AMD as well in his portfolio.Edit: Grammatical mistakes",0,nan,nan,nan

Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update.

,"[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link] I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor. So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far.

The fact that a “small company” can achieve a very high growth rate, in a large market, after they come out with an excellent product, is hardly surprising (sorry for awkward sentence).The fact that Intel still grew 3 times more then the company with the superior product, is however surprising, and should be a warning sign. Now it changed in the latest quarter, but with 18b in cash, one “bad quarter” probably won’t break the bank.Maybe I’m wrong and AMD will take control of the semiconductor market, but it will take many years, and a lot of things can happen in 20 years.So it’s a bet, more then a sure thing. If people like that, that’s cool, but it’s not for me, and I don’t think that it’s for the novice investor that will find posts like yours interesting.",2,nan,nan,nan

EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update.

Positions: AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.","The integration of Xilinx will hurt results in the upcoming quarters after acquisition is closed since it is not immediately accretive to AMD's bottom line since Xilinx would need to double its profits to not be dilutive. It could work out in the end giving AMD a foothold in FPGAs and 5G but this is a long term play & personally I think most of the momentum will be sucked out of AMD until it is proven that the Xilinx merger was accretive. Bolt on acquisitions are usually what drives stock prices higher short term.Personally, I would wait but if you think its a steal at $75 go for it but I see a growth company adding a non-growth company in a field that they are not proficient in. I still remember the ATA acquisition by AMD and that was a disaster.",0,nan,nan,nan

Of course, as soon as I do, AMD starts going back up in price, not nearly enough to gain my cost basis back, but it was trading at about $3.50 per share earlier today.AMD's price seems to completely ignore sentiment and earnings projections and there's nothing close on the horizon to make money off of unless you're holding leaps or lots of stock.

Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same. Positions: AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.","Look at actual earnings. Do you know how many processors and growth AMD would have to make to justify their current price? That’s what I mean when I say look at fundamentals. You invest in things that are relatively undervalued compared to the market. In this case I say hard assets (gold, btc, maybe real estate) and dividend paying stocks.

This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update.

It also depends on how institutional shareholders value a company. And we have seen that even institutional shareholders can be wrong about valuation (TSLA).I believe some of them miss the 'engineering' knowledge to really understand these semiconductor markets. ASML was slept on for a long time because the technology wasn't understood and it was a Dutch stock.The inverse can also happen. A good example of this is that Blackberry stock was still trading at high levels when everyone was switching to Iphones.

ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update.

,"[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link] I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor. So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?

The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in TAM: Total Available Market. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits. New GPU Reveal Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market. This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO RISK Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right? Conclusion I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same. Positions: AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.",Aged well already haha!,0,nan,nan,nan
,"[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link] I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor. So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address: Q3 Earnings Report First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$). 35B Xilinx Takeover Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint: AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term.
