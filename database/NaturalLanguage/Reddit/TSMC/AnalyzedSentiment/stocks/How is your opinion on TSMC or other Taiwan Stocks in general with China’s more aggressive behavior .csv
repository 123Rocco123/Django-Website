,I have some shares of TSMC and I still think it is a great stock. My plan was to hold it long term. But China’s behavior against Taiwan is concerning me. Is this only a political move or are there chances this goes sideways real soon? What is your opinion on this?,"The problem is not with China, but the claim that the ASML machines use US technology.So TSMC is being told not to sell to China, the newer chipsets, which is their largest customer.-All the capacity is already booked for by customers, the Huawei share has been taken over by AMD and Samsung. So no worry for the near future profits.-The Biden administration is even more anti-China, but more willing to listen to the needs of US businesses, supply chains concerned.-disclaimer. I own TSMC so I'm biased.",0,nan,nan,nan

Is this only a political move or are there chances this goes sideways real soon? What is your opinion on this?,I don’t mean the trade dispute. Also it is most likely part of the problem. My concern is that china could try to get taiwan back. They send some fighters into taiwan airspace. And there tone got more aggressive about the independence of taiwan.,1,nan,nan,nan

Is this only a political move or are there chances this goes sideways real soon? What is your opinion on this?,"I don't own any TSMC, but since they are building in AZ. They're not gong anywhere. They now have the US behind them. That was a strategic move. TSMC sell chips to the Chinese also. Much of the tool IP in TSMC is owned by the US and Dutch. China likes to rattle some swords every once in a while, this has been going on for many years.",0,nan,nan,nan
