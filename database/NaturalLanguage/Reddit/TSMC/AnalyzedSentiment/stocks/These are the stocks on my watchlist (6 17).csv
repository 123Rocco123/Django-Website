But I noticed him talking about it last month, wish I bought then but I did get in at $10 and scheduled a buy for more shares this morning last night. I bought after seeing more people talking about it and actually checking the stock out. The financials are good and the thing I love about it is they already have a finished product. It works. They have satellites doing their thing right now, with more to come to finish the current planned scope of satellites in the next 2-4 years. They just signed a deal with AT&T. Verizon just put $100m into them last month. It's a serious stock to keep an eye on and do your own due diligence, but it's not a meme stock like I thought when I saw it at a couple bucks and didn't bother to researchDisclaimer: I am also not a trader or analyst. I only started investing this year and have a Wendy's application on standby",1,nan,nan,nan
