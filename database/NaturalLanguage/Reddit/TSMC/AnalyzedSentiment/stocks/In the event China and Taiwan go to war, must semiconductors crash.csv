Oil won't be going anywhere as much as people want to think it will, instead it will probably drift into the background, and I think oil companies will be ok with that because they're probably as sick of negative publicity as much you're sick of hearing about them.",2,nan,nan,nan

It seems a war between two, either hot war or cold war, is inevitable. But the bad news for Taiwan is that they are under political pressure to build fabs outside, for example, in Arizona, which making them more disposable in case of a war. IMO, the best defence for them is to keep all advanced fabs at home, thus making them more crucial to the world in case of a war.",0,nan,nan,nan
