,"Or is it all already 'priced in' at current prices? https://www.google.com/search?q=AMD%2C+Apple%2C+and+Nvidia+Reportedly+Cutting+Back+on+TSMC+5nm+Orders Apple managed to cut down the initial shipment of iPhone 14 chips by around 10%. AMD, on the other hand, revised its orders for 7nm and 6nm wafers, reportedly lowering the amounts by around 20,000. This applies to shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023. However, AMD hasn’t changed its order for 5nm wafers intended for PCs and servers. Nvidia seems to be in a sticky spot compared to the other two tech giants. It made prepayments to TSMC to secure their 5nm wafers for the upcoming RTX 4000-series of graphics cards. Now, facing a drastic drop in consumer demand, Nvidia tried to alter its order — but according to DigiTimes, TSMC wouldn’t budge. The companies came to an agreement where the first shipments will be delayed by one quarter, but Nvidia is now supposed to find replacement customers for TSMC’s vacated production capacity.","The chip glut is coming Micron is shutting down some of its production, they also claim they wont drop their prices to fill orders though, but their forward estimates have dropped by 2 billion we'll see. Intel is dropping their prices, and most likely they going to scale back their new Ohio Fab.",0,nan,nan,nan

There's still device shortages. A lot still have months lead time to order minus the really big stuff that usually isn't replaced or purchased as often. Think servers etc that start @ 40-50k - 500k. (But then even some of those are still back ordered depending on the company.)But I think every ones forecasting is now all F'ed.

Though everyone is expecting a lousy quarter and it probably will be, any hint of getting past this by AAPL will send the stock up quite bit very quickly. Plus, unless you believe Putin will wage war forever even without ammo or soldiers left, and the Fed will continue raising rates long after the economy has slowed down, this is the time to BUY. Everything except cryptos or TSLA, the latter because of its ultra high PE which is not justified.To me, the real golden goose is AAPL. My Colombian girlfriend's iphone died yesterday and boy did she panic. ""I spend my whole life on that phone, I run my business on that phone, I need a new one now, please send $800"". Then, as I queried her about fixing her old iPhone she ignored me and just bought a new one on credit for the asking price. She couldn't bear to be without it even for a few hours. Therefore, multiple her by a billion and contemplate the reality of today's world.Besides basic food and survival, the iPhone is the top priority. I have seen homeless people with iPhones. In 2008, at the pits of that crash, I had 250,000 cash and decided to go all in when no one was buying stocks. I had to pick a stock though. I did the same mental math about ""what is the last thing young people will give up even if there is a depression?"" I decided it was the iPhone. I bought AAPl at $15 a share and accumuated more on steep selloffs and now have 55,000 shares. Warren Buffett also added to AAPL's value when he went heavily in, his first tech stock ever. So, in the time period when IO was growing my wealth with AAPL, through ups and downs, gold has been all over the place, cryptos were born, peaked during the covid lockdowns then crashed and now seem likely to die and disappear. and ten years from now if I dont sell any, my AAPL shares will probably be worth around 15 million dollars. So ,let this be a lesson. Want longterm stability and wealth growth? Invest in AAPL, and right now at $139, it is a bargain. No real risk at all.",0,nan,nan,nan
