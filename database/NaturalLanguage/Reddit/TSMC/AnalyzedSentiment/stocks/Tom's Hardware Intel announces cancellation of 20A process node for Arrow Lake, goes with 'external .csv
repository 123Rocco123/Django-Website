However, Intel’s 20A served as a vehicle for several new advances, like RibbonFet Gate-All-Around (GAA) technology, which is Intel’s first new transistor design since FinFET arrived in 2011. It also marked the debut of the company’s PowerVia backside power delivery tech, which routes power for the transistors through the backside of the processor die.Intel says the learnings it gained from its 20A node have contributed to the success of its 18A node, which makes sense given that 18A is a tighter refinement of the technologies invented for 20A.It appears that Intel will now leapfrog over its 20A process entirely and avoid the capital expenditures required to bring the node to full production.“",1,nan,nan,nan
