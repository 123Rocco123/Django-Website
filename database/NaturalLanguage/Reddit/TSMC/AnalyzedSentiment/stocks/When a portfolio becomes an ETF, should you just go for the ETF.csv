,"I am still very bullish on semiconductors and have been buying AMD (and later TSMC) for quite some time. After the recent run in AMD I sold a part of my position, figuring it might cool off and I could take some profits. While I was thinking about where I wanted to reinvest I started to think about Nvidia which became quite interesting after their recent split. I kinda also wanted ASML and finally did some DD on Intel (Intel could go either way). At this point I figured, I might as well just buy a semiconductor ETF and play it safe. Year to date TSMC and AMD were both outperformed by VanEck Vectors Semiconductor UCITS ETF (VVSM) anyway, so I would have made more if the same amount of cash would have gone in the ETF. The ETF has a 0.35% fee so I should keep that in mind. And yes, YTD NVIDIA and ASML were the better choice, but I've been in AMD a bit longer and TSMC might have been a bad choice (bought in february). I see three options next (10+ year investment horizon + DCA for these): Invest in TSMC, AMD, NVIDIA, ASML and let them ride. Play it safe and go for the ETF that consists of 10.8% NVIDIA, 10.5% ASML, 9.3% TSMC, 8.7% Intel, 6.11% AMD and a bunch of others (25 positions total) in the same sector. 3 A bit more risk/reward: pick a potential winner and go all in with either NVIDIA, ASML or AMD. So what would you do? And did you experience the same in another sector where your portfolio was basically becoming an ETF, what did you do?","This is a good idea I was thinking the same scenario exactly like the OP stated. Maybe I wil go 50% SOXX, 25% ASML, and 25% TSM. OR something similar",0,nan,nan,nan
