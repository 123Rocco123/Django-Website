Nothing you said is incorrect about semis in general, but the semis market is absolutely not even remotely close to a down cycle. Demand is off the charts. Profit margins contracted slightly because inflation works bottom-up, e.g. component prices increase first and price increases roll up the chain over time. But, while margins reduced slightly, revenue gained massively. Net profits off the charts across the board, and that's even with bottlenecks delaying orders like crazy. As those bottlenecks ease, component pricing will decrease, and production will increase. Your assessment that we're entering a down cycle is utter nonsense. I'd even go so far as to say that semis are becoming recession proof because people cut back on basically everything except tech. Tech just keeps growing. I doubt semis makers will be able to actually outpace demand again until after INTC's Ohio fab is at full capacity -- even then, they'd need additional TSM and Samsung fabs to get caught up.

For training, a GPU is pretty much your only practical choice. For actual application, Gpu is still preferred option, but CPU becomes more viable if the task is very small.Traditional machine learning models like K-means, random forests, Support Vector Machines and etc are generally ran on CPU, but in most cases, they hardly stresses the CPU enough to justify the need of the highest end CPU.With that said, since cpu are so cheap compared to GPUs, most buy a highend cpu as well.",6,nan,nan,nan

Shipping containers are being blocked and delayed. Russia and China have also decided to back N. Korea, who sees US/Japan/S. Korean cooperation essentially as an Asian NATO. This has resulted in N. Korea getting the go ahead (via Russian and Chinese vetos at the UN security council) for increased weapons testing and regular/constant threats toward S. Korea. N. Korea is specifically threatening S. Korea's semis and tech companies because Samsung, SK Hynix, LG, etc. represent most of S. Korea's economy. But, that's really just the tip of the iceberg. Imo, Korea is in a similar boat to Taiwan, except Taiwan is being threatened by China, which is reasonably stable and not known for being rash.... alternatively, S. Korea is being threatened by a legit lunatic whose country is increasingly desperate, and whose primary economic activity is their military.",4,nan,nan,nan

Edit: Since this post, 1month ago, TSM, is up 2.8% and AMD is up 20.95%","AMD when it comes to data centers and GPUs is a cheaper alternative to NVDA. It’s not really fair to compare TSM with AMD because both operate very differently - for starters, ones a chip designer while the other is further upstream producing wafers. Also, they operate in different markets and don’t compete with another in any shape or form. You also have to pay a risk premium for investing in Taiwan as opposed to US markets. So if you are looking to buy a chip designer, I would say buying AMD, albeit smaller market share to the others but robust growth, is a cheaper purchase currently; I have been building a position at these levels recently. At the end of the day, it depends on inflation and the Fed if this valuation makes sense. If inflation has peaked, this valuation is attractive compared to their comps.",0,nan,nan,nan
