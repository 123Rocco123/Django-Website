Reshoring Chipmaking Capacity Requires High-Skilled Foreign Talent Estimating the Labor Demand Generated by CHIPS Act Incentives CSET Policy Brief","The western (and most of the global) community lifted a huge economic finger, effectively destroying Russia’s economy, and lead to Germany 3x their military spending in a year. Short of an armed conflict with nato, there has been a massive, unified, response.While the strategic importance of Taiwan will exist, the U.S. willingness to defend Taiwan against China will likely diminish significantly once there are domestic fabs. Domestic fabs will reduce the necessary reliance on a small island near a giant country unfriendly to them.It would be great for there to a thorn in China’s side, but their biggest asset is their chip manufacturing and there’s not a chance China moves on Taiwan with the U.S.’s current disposition (aka “they supply our chips and we aren’t letting China control these chips”).This ignores the logistical challenges of an actual military invasion of Taiwan and if China’s previous actions are anything to go off of, they’re more likely to do the Hong Kong approach via friendly government actors and money.",2,nan,nan,nan

And, until a couple of years from now, it's a critical supplier of technology. Militarily, it's of little value when we have Japan, which isn't critical when we have air and sea superiority.In a fight, either we'll sink the entire Chinese fleet in a few days (100% certainty if they attacked today) or we'll let them have Taiwan to minimize the damage and to give us even more moral authority while vaporizing theirs.Chinese rhetoric gets way out past its physical capabilities.

Reshoring Chipmaking Capacity Requires High-Skilled Foreign Talent Estimating the Labor Demand Generated by CHIPS Act Incentives CSET Policy Brief","This. The best way for China to see the West lose interest in Taiwan is for there to exist competing advanced fabs.With China, Europe & the West throwing down to secure advanced chip capability, it's just a matter of time before the supply chains are independent enough that the US doesn't care about Taiwan again.So China, which tends to play a long game, has little incentive to rush into a military conflict over Taiwan and can wait for the current war over advanced semiconductor fabs to subside.This ignores the logistical challenges of an actual military invasion of Taiwan and if China’s previous actions are anything to go off of, they’re more likely to do the Hong Kong approach via friendly government actors and money.I agree with this. Very recently (this week?), China has been making overtures to Hong Kong to make their semi-independent status permanent instead of having it expire in 2047. That can only appeal to people in Taiwan who are afraid of war and might envision a workable democracy existing under a communist central government (if that's even possible).",3,nan,nan,nan
