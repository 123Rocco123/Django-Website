If you're still investing, I think UMC is a strong choice. GMI evaluation has them in the high 90s, a peg ratio of 0.58 and a +267% performance in the past year. On top of it all it's only 9.05 dollars a share(as of this comment post). I think they are sorely undervalued for the growth they might achieve. The ford equity research article rates them as a number 1 rating with potential share increase to 18 dollars a share within 6-12 months. I'm pretty confident you can make a lot out of UMC.",0,nan,nan,nan
