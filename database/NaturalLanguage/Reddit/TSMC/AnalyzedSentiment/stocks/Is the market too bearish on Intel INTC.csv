,"Disclosure: I do have a small position (Less than $2,000) in Intel but am looking for some insight from others before I invest more. Intel has made numerous missteps in the past few years (Intel Optane while a great product ended up only being used in datacenter environments, 10nm slipped for years, until recently their CPU microarchitecture was arguably inferior to AMD's Zen 2) and the list goes on. However they have a new CEO with an engineering background who to me seems to be taking the company in the right direction over the long term. Intel is investing heavily in building new fabs and they claim their 18A node is ahead of schedule, while TSMC has delayed their N3 node. Intel Alder lake is very competitive with AMD's latest offerings and Intel Arc could eventually capture a large part of the GPU market. The market cap of Intel is currently ~182 billion, with a P/E Ratio of 7.41, and a dividend yield of 3.28%. The stock has been relatively flat since 2018. By comparison, TSMC who only fabs chips has a market cap of ~468 billion, a P/E ratio of 20.59 and a dividend yield of 1.62. AMD which designs chips but owns no fabs has a market cap of ~165 billion, a P/E Ratio of 38.14, and no dividend. Intel has both fabs and designs their own chips yet is only valued slightly higher than AMD? Intel has the dominant market share in Servers, Desktop, and Mobile (laptop) processors, although AMD has been gaining ground. Intel will soon be competing directly with TSMC by fabricating third party chips in Intel's fabs. My question, does the market's bearish sentiment on Intel make any sense? Provided Intel doesn't delay their roadmaps I am finding it very difficult to believe that Intel should be valued at only 182 billion. Thank you for your insights ahead of time!","All the ratios on Intel say undervalued/fairly valued, but the issue for me (even though I have a small position in INTC also) is that you really have to believe in the fab plans to want to buy in right now. And we likely won't see the positives of that for years to come, its going to be years of costs before we see if that turns the ship around. Revenue is going down, other chip makers are trying to get in on Intel's space, and they are in the process of spending a lot of money to make moves in changing the company. It makes sense to be hesitant. I only really got in because in my mind, if someone asked me if I wanted to buy the 2nd biggest chip designer and the 3rd (I believe?) biggest fab company in the world in one stock I'd probably jump on it.",0,nan,nan,nan

Intel is running at capacity, ergo it makes sense that having more capacity would increase revenues all else being equal.The Semi market is growing and although AMD is getting a bigger slice of the pie than they used to, the pie is getting larger and AMD doesn't even make their own pie just the recipe. So they have to compete for fab space. Intel is going to take a huge chunk of TSMC's 3nm so AMD will have to content with both Intel and Apple for space reducing how many chips they can even make, superior product or not there's huge demand.Then there's lots of geopolitical issues with worries about Taiwan leading to investments in the US and Europe to get fabs built out. Intel stands to benefit the most from these initiatives.Intel has huge profits and can afford all this, they're also going to IPO Mobileye at a rumored $50billion valuation.As for innovation Intel has been failing hard at manufacturing. How is it possible Intel's 14nm chips were able to even compete with AMD's 10nm if not for good design? Despite having shitty manufacturing Intel hasn't been that far behind AMD and in latest consumer CPUs is actually ahead I believe. But that's not AMD beating Intel, that's TSMC beating them, and TSMC is selling Intel lots of fab space which will erode much of AMD's advantage regardless of how intel's fabs do.As for the the specific $40 mark, their forward PE is like 12 I believe. How are they not worth at least $40 lol. Why don't you use actual logic to tell me why Intel should be valued at less $40/share, use actual numbers and not wishy washy ""AMD good, Intel Bad"" logic. Because all their numbers have them at a reasonable ratio despite the huge spend.EDIT: Oh forgot to mention doesn't Intel have dibs on the newest Hi-NA EUV from ASML machines over TSMC?",4,nan,nan,nan

Thank you for your insights ahead of time!","Does the bearish sentiment make sense? Yes, the question is whether or not Intel can turn things around. Maybe they can, maybe they cannot.Personally I have about 10% in Intel, was 15% at one point, which I reduced when it got a little to ahead of itself. I also own 6% in AMD and a chunk of TSMC and ASML. I bought AMD via Xilinx, since the 15% arbitrage looked like a reasonable risk to me.I like Intel because I think it's got good fundamentals, and it's in an industry I think I understand better than most. I also think it's a good defensive stock, and it returns a dividend. So that makes it a good long term play for a tax deferred retirement account.Generally speaking over the past couple of decades there has been a back and forth with Intel and AMD. Every 5 years or so they change places as each makes a mistep. Intel made the last mistep with their approach to EUV for making chips. However, it was exactly that a mistep, and not a fundament cut in R&D. They have the cash flow and resources to recover, and likely will. Right now they are first in line for ASML's next set of EUV machines, which means they'll be ahead of TSMC for a while on that front. There have also been rumors of a TSMC mistep at 3 nm, which could be nothing, could be a delay.So overtime I expect Intel to regain dominance in the field, and AMD to shift back again. When that will happen is hard to say, AMD has been doing very well of late. I also don't know when Intel will start to regain the ground. What I do know is that Intel outspends AMD and Nvidia in R&D, even accounting for the inefficencies of a massive company like Intel. They also have a oligarchy on fabs with only TSMC and Samsung being able to compete. Further the number of fabs on the bleeding edge has been going down to the point that I expect that to provide Intel with a nice moat.I also like some of the internal bits of Intel that don't get as much discussion. I think MobilEye is most likely to win the autonomous car race, with their advantage in data. Intel also has nice plays in AI, Internet of Things, photonics, and a wide range of other cutting edge tech. They're more than just their processors, a lot more.Since I'm a retail trader I don't have access to a lot of insider info, nor which makes it difficult to know. I'm assuming that whenever the transformation happens it will likely be pretty quick, likely afterhours when I cannot trade, with bots soaking up a lot of the sudden spike. So I'm willing to be a bit early to the party and collect an above average dividend in the mean time.",0,nan,nan,nan

These are massively government subsidised, and the US is looking at implementing an act to get chip manufacturing increased in the US. This would give US chip manufacturers a further 52 billion in government subsidies.Intel isn’t going to be a huge growth stock as it’s a fully mature business, but it trades at a low forward PE compared to other tech stocks, and it pays a dividend over over 3% (I know dividends aren’t popular with everyone).I think it’s a decent long play. Intel isn’t going anywhere. They absolutely DOMINATE the OEM space. Go into just about any large corporation and they’re all running Intel CPUs on their desktops and laptops.It’s hard to get an unbiased opinion about Intel on Reddit because there’s a weird Intel vs AMD thing that goes on (I use a Ryzen 5600 myself). So many can’t see past a few gaming benchmarks or pass mark scores, and they base an entire industry on those numbers. There’s GPU compute (which Intel isn’t good at yet), supercomputer, OEM, future investment, fabs, TSMC risks (macro) etc.As Buffet always says, you want the right management in a business you invest in, and I think Gelsinger will be good for Intel.

They were just analysts doing what they always do: look at the numbers.So I do think that it's 100% possible to beat 'professional' chip analysts if you're able to spot great chips (and correctly assess their market potential) before the actual revenue comes in.However, predicting the long term succes of zen was much easier, or at least very different than predicting a successful reinvention of Intel.Essentially, my bet is that pat gelsingers strategy is a necessary one (the only viable one from the perspective of national security and supply chain resilience) and that even if they keep fucking up for the foreseeable future, they've realised it in time, and Intel still has the resources to pull the nose up.The biggest risk in my opinion isn't that the strategy keeps failing even if they keep trying - that would be too pessimistic.

I think NVIDIA is leading the charge entirely in this space, and will be a better medium-long term play as all verticals have use for AI/ML -- more expensive and a higher ROI than CPU based hardware deployment. Additionally, GPU usage in crypto is not being replaced by anything in a substantial way (Chia I guess?), so there's a couple good examples of trends moving away from CPU hardware. Together, I'd say Intel is a ""safe"" play but I don't see any huge breakthroughs for that type of hardware, whereas NVIDIA is actually losing stock value despite the huge potential to lead AI/ML for the next few decades (until Quantum computing/Neuromorphic computing becomes feasible economically).",0,nan,nan,nan

AMD - while arguably still significantly overvalued - is expected to grow significantly valued for the expected growth (+ hype, unfortunately)Intel may turn around, but that's far from a given, and apparently it's not expected. Even if their products catch up it's hard to estimate if/when that will turn sentiment around. Due to the performance of many years, there's very negative sentiment towards Intel GPUs in customers, especially casual customers who just whip out a quick google search to decide. I think you can make a case for Intel, I definitely think you can. But I don't think it's a steal or anywhere close to being a steal right now. Also, please don't look at trailing P/E. What kind of information do you expect to get from that?Since the market is forward looking, if I look at a P/E I'd like to look at it on a forward basis. F P/E for Intel is around 12. For a company expected to not grow revenue at all and to see earnings decline significantly, that's not particularly cheap. It's not particularly expensive either, although you probably would expect 6% growth or so for that kind of P/E while Intel's growth after the decline is expected to sit around 2-3.5% annually",0,nan,nan,nan

If you think people will realize that 7.41 is too cheap of a P/E for Intel and buy it up causing the P/E to increase while the Earnings don’t decline then it could be a buy.The reason AMD for example has a higher P/E than INTC is because AMD is expected earnings to grow from $2.79/share in 2021 to $5/share in 2023 (79% over 2 years) while intel is expected to shrink earnings from $5.47 in 2021 to $3.60 in 2023 (-34% over 2 years).This is a guessing game, a 7 P/E doesn’t mean that a stock is undervalued, it means that it’s not expected to grow. If you disagree with the market’s sentiment then there is an opportunity here.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"Disclosure: I do have a small position (Less than $2,000) in Intel but am looking for some insight from others before I invest more. Intel has made numerous missteps in the past few years (Intel Optane while a great product ended up only being used in datacenter environments, 10nm slipped for years, until recently their CPU microarchitecture was arguably inferior to AMD's Zen 2) and the list goes on. However they have a new CEO with an engineering background who to me seems to be taking the company in the right direction over the long term. Intel is investing heavily in building new fabs and they claim their 18A node is ahead of schedule, while TSMC has delayed their N3 node. Intel Alder lake is very competitive with AMD's latest offerings and Intel Arc could eventually capture a large part of the GPU market. The market cap of Intel is currently ~182 billion, with a P/E Ratio of 7.41, and a dividend yield of 3.28%. The stock has been relatively flat since 2018. By comparison, TSMC who only fabs chips has a market cap of ~468 billion, a P/E ratio of 20.59 and a dividend yield of 1.62. AMD which designs chips but owns no fabs has a market cap of ~165 billion, a P/E Ratio of 38.14, and no dividend. Intel has both fabs and designs their own chips yet is only valued slightly higher than AMD? Intel has the dominant market share in Servers, Desktop, and Mobile (laptop) processors, although AMD has been gaining ground. Intel will soon be competing directly with TSMC by fabricating third party chips in Intel's fabs. My question, does the market's bearish sentiment on Intel make any sense? Provided Intel doesn't delay their roadmaps I am finding it very difficult to believe that Intel should be valued at only 182 billion. Thank you for your insights ahead of time!","intel is building 2 new fabs and they will move to the fab model, the investment will come to fruition on the balance sheet around 2025-2026. what will happen with the stock is also depending on the chip industry and china situations. long term thats a good price to buy in i would say.",0,nan,nan,nan

With $2k, you might as well throw it on a more aggressive growth stock to generate a bigger return. I would only keep larger sums of money in Intel as a low risk stock with slight upside if June doesn't end up being a bloodbath supreme.",0,nan,nan,nan

Or meet the expectations of the fabs, which will take few years.I think is undervalued because it didn't deliver for long time. Potentially will outperform, but it's not riskless.(I have a position in INTC)",0,nan,nan,nan
