,"I own some LRCX and also some TSM. Lately I've been wondering how safe it is investing in TSM because of China trade wars, etc. Is it safe investing in TSM? Could US investors somehow lose their money if something went down? I was also curious who buys products from companies such as Lam Research, Applied Materials, and maybe KLAC. Does TSMC use products from any of those companies? Why doesn't the US manufacture semiconductors is another curiosity I've had recently? Thanks.",US would probably go to war if something happened to TSMC.,0,nan,nan,nan

Taiwan has its own government, its own army, its own laws, etc.China ""lets"" us invest in TSM because china has no control over TSM.However, if China were to try and take control of TSM, then they're right, the US would go to war since the US and Taiwan are strategic military allies.",2,nan,nan,nan

Closest it has been related to China probably when Chiang Kai Shek retreated from the war against Chairman Mao. Chiang pretty much invaded Taiwan which already has its own local population.

(eg US told ASML to stop Smic equipment)TSM rely heavily in US and other companies around the world to supply them equipment. That is why when US tell TSM to stop supply Huawei chip, TSM listen.The thing with the semiconductor industry is, once your ahead, it is hard for the player behind to catch up. Because to create the most advanced chip, you need huge amount of investment. Not only that, you need ""customers"" which is what provide the funding for new investment.",0,nan,nan,nan

Intel (intc)They are behind on the production node, is slower, uses more electricity, less secure, and have failed to deliver on roadmaps (delayed products)New CEO recently though, so maybe things are looking up from here.
