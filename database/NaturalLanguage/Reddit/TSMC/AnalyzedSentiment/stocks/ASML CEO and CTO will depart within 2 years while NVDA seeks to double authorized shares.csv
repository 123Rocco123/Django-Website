,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

Dow Jones Newswire""Nvidia is seeking shareholder approval to double the number of authorized shares to 8 billion--a year after doubling the number of authorized shares to 4 billion and effecting a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a dividend. The latest proposal would again require support from a majority of the shares outstanding. Abstentions and broker non-votes would be the same as a vote against, the company says. Nvidia's board backs the proposed amendment, saying the additional shares would give the company discretion to take certain actions, without further shareholder approval, for such things as stock splits, equity incentives and more.
