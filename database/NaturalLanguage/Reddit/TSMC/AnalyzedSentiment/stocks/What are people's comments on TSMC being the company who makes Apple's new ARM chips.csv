I feel like jumping the gun and getting in too early is sometimes pointless.,"If your a long term investor, the best time to get in is now. trying to time stuff is hard, and you won't get it right. if your trading, then it might have gotten a little overheated. but so has the Nasdaq. disclaimer: longtime tsm holder, plan on holding for a long time.",0,nan,nan,nan

I feel like jumping the gun and getting in too early is sometimes pointless.,"Cited story: Building a new fab that will start making chips in 2024 if all goes to schedule (with 5nm that isn't guaranteed).... Normal TSMC news. Neutral.Apple Desktops were 5% of Intel production, but TSMC is bigger so will be less than 5% sales gain for TSMC. TSMC just lost 15% of upcoming sales when Huawei sales went to zero due to new export laws that likely won't change soon. That doesn't seem to have worked its way into TSMCs stock price, currently at all time highs in the current ""frothy"" market (or whatever you want to call it).So I guess.... it doesn't seem like the Apple deal will matter much overall for TSMC and if we just look at these two recent big sales changes the negative still outweighs the positive.If I switch to guessing what's going on I would guess the share prices are being supported by the dividend, but the payout ratio (how much of the earnings is being paid as dividends) has shot up from 50% to 75% in the three years through 2019 (and is 94% for the last twelve months!) so that dividend can't get much higher and can't handle much of a dip in earnings. Meanwhile semiconductors remains one of the most cyclical of industries due to the massive capital costs and cutthroat ultimate product prices.I'm not a buyer at these share prices.",0,nan,nan,nan

I feel like jumping the gun and getting in too early is sometimes pointless.,I currently have 10 shares of TSMC and plan on buying more. Almost all the recent news on this company (aside from the Huawei loss) has been positive.Be interesting to see if they will apply for a license in order to continue to do business with Huawei after Sep. Wonder what the licensing requirements will even be.,0,nan,nan,nan
