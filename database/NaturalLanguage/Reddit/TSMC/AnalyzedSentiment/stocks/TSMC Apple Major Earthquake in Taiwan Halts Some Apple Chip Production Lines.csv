,"A 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan in the early hours of the morning, killing at least nine people, injuring hundreds, and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including disrupting operations at several TSMC key manufacturing sites. Sources familiar with TSMC's operations said that the company's N3 fab in Tainan suffered structural damage, with beams and columns broken, leading to an outright halt in production. EUV machines, essential for manufacturing processes below 7nm, have stopped, and research and development labs have been subject to significant damage, such as cracked walls. Another fab in Hsinchu reported broken pipelines and extensive damage to wafers, necessitating a halt in production. https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/major-earthquake-in-taiwan/","The TSMC fabs are build on dampeners for exactly this reason, their engineers aren’t idiots. Production might get halted but the fab will be fine.",0,nan,nan,nan

And I bet companies seeking some of TSMCs production capacity care.Apple uses the most advanced process nodes. To be economical (for tsmc) you need to run those expensive machine non stop.Capacity is also constrained. They are using 100% of it. So delays inevitably mean someone is screwed even if it isn’t Apple.Also, the damage didn’t sound slight. Sounded significant.",1,nan,nan,nan
