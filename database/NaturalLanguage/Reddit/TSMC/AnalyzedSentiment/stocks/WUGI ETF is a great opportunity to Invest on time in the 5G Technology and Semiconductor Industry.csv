,"$WUGI 5G Technology ETF WUGI is an actively-managed ETF, been holding for a month with nice gains that dont appear to slow down. We agree that 5G will empower the next generation of technology that will rise the global digital economy. 5G is not a light-switch; it is an evolution. They invest in that long-term growth with adjusting allocations dynamically as the 5G cycle evolves. There 5G assumptions are based on 4 Pillars.. Semis are the nucleus of 5G: Every existing device and every facet of the 5G cycle must be upgraded with new semiconductor technology to run faster and smarter, while being more energy-efficient. 5G will require a massive expansion of semiconductor content. Because everything needs a Semi now! From your cellphone to your washing machines, Cars, Smart Homes, Drones. Heaviest investment sector of this ETF, companies like $AMD $TSMC $NVDA $QCOM. Cloud giants push into Edge Computing: Edge Computing and 5G are interlinked technologies as both are poised to significantly improve the performance of applications (faster speed) and enable huge amounts of data to be processed in real-time (low latency). Applications running on edge locations demand lower latency and reduced bandwidth. FAAMG stocks come into play here and are VERY important. Cloud-native software to manage data: 5G will result in a massive amount of new data. The ability to continuously filter and process this new data in real-time will be critical. A new generation of database platforms, big data analytics, and agile software development tools are emerging to help individuals and businesses build digital experiences. $NVDA and its Datacenter come to play, $NET, $TWLO, $AMZN AWS. The growth will not slow down. Enabling Technologies: When all 5G building blocks are in place, the potential big winners will likely be the enabling technologies (think of Instagram and Netflix in the 4G cycle), giving rise to a wave of new 5G business applications, devices, and services. Companies like $SE with huge gaming plataforms, as the cycle evolves there will be clearer players here. % Top 10 Holdings: Sea Ltd 7.98% NVIDIA Corp 7.97% AMD 7.94% Meituan Dianping 5.85% Marvell Technology Group Ltd 5.44% Qualcomm Inc 5.26% Bilibili Inc 4.32% Taiwan Semiconductors 4.09% Google 4.05% Microsoft Corp 3.70% % Top Industry Group: Software 36.14% Internet 22.27% Commercial Services 3.84% Computers 0.97% Hope this helps!
