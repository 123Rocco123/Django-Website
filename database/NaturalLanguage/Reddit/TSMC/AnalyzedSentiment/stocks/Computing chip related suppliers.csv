Not a lot of goodwill, and a lot of their depreciation probably isn't as big as shown on book. Theyve got a lot leaner debt wise in the last 2-3 years. While their business is cyclical, its looking like the new ""bottoms"" will have them earning 7-8 per share and the tops could be really, really high. While cyclical, they're baseline level of sales does seem to always be rising.Throw in possible biden bill aid as they're only major US supplier of ram and they're looking very, very spicy. The massive holdings by Pabrai, Li Lu, and Tepper also give confidence others see it as undervalued. And all of them are recorded owning the shares at 88, so if you can snag them at 80 your outperforming David Tepper and Monish Pabrai by 10% :)",1,nan,nan,nan

Applied materials and lam research are the biggest companies for the rest of the fabrication process. KLA Tencor makes a lot of metrology equip for fabs as well. There are other big players but I don’t think they’re public, if they are they might be held by other companies",0,nan,nan,nan

Anglo Canadian company who design chips and sell licenses to manufacture from their patents. Continuous income stream with no worries on manufacturing or supply chains. IPO was a couple of months ago in the mini tech crunch causing a drop to around 300 pence from 380 IPO, currently back up between 350 and 360 pence and on a bull run. A good chance to get into a freshly IPO'd company who have been profitable for 3 years already. If you're going to buy though use a limit order as trading volumes can be sporadic and a market order could cause you to pay over the odds.",0,nan,nan,nan
