,"People have been saying time and again that the technological market, specifically A.I., is nowhere near its peak. With the changing times and eras, stocks in the A.I. sector will continue to grow and reach new highs. However, with the sudden news yesterday announced by both candidates for the 2024 US President, it seems like a big hit to global chip stocks, including ASML, Nvidia, and TSMC. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration is considering a sweeping rule to clamp down on companies exporting their critical chipmaking equipment to China. Trump added further negative sentiment to semiconductor stocks by saying Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense, while also claiming Taiwan took ""about 100%"" of America's semiconductor business. Is this the final phase of the A.I. bubble? This is a chart I drew myself with the help of an external website. Hopefully this helps with explaining that after the pandemic dip in 2020, this is the second largest dip the semiconductor stock has experienced",This post tells me you did not hold stock during the Trump presidency lol.

My buddy's wife purchased an electric toothbrush a couple weeks ago that has Bluetooth connectivity and an app. That's fucking stupid, but it was purchased is the point.A lot of these chip uses are less stupid and function well as productivity aids and there is going to be massive hunger for productivity aids over the next 20-25 years at minimum as we deal with demographic changes. Old people are notoriously unproductive and need a lot of productivity to care for them.And that's just the US. Worldwide, as usual, the rest of the world would really like to get ahold of the luxuries we have here. There's plenty of room for market expansionWhat the correct AA is for you personally is an individual call, but I can't imagine not at least having a small semi/tech tilt.",0,nan,nan,nan

The semiconductor industry is capital intensive with boom and bust cycles. PS multiples today are what PE multiples were 10 years ago. It’s a bubble, given where we are in the Fed cycle I doubt this is the beginning of the bubble popping.
