I saw one that said 2099 but I assume that was a placeholder. We use PSOCs as our mcu and they have been sold out for over a year with no break in sight.,2,nan,nan,nan

They said they're now able to produce as much as they're sell, but the back log is so large that it would take 3 quarters to clear with no new sales. Honestly I expect some problems to persist into 2024.",1,nan,nan,nan

At semis companies to help get them caught up and/or back into the US.The GOP has been holding it up for partisan political points for over a year. They all wanted it when Trump could have signed it. Now that it'd be a win for Biden, they are obstructing.They did the same with Solar/PV manufacturing under Obama, and as a result, China now owns the solar manufacturing industry, which gave them a massive leg up in semis. It also cost Americans trillions of dollars in jobs and sales (both in and out of country).This is literally watching the decline of American ""exceptionalism""....all for dumb politics.",1,nan,nan,nan

We are backlogged years. Our component suppliers are backlogged years. Our customers are backlogged years. And, their customers are backlogged years (E: all of this is public info from ER conference calls).Venturebeat is dead wrong. Literally every CEO of every semis company who did a conference call during their ER said basically, ""Demand is easing, and we anticipate a downward trend in the larger economy to decrease demand for electronics, but it will take much more time to be back to normal levels. We still have many orders to catch up on.""Also, remember that at ""normal levels"", basically every semis company is making bank. They are rolling in mountains of cash. Lol.That said, I'm still playing SQQQ, UVXY, and puts on overpriced tech -- just as I've been telling everyone here to do for ~8 months. Best of luck.",0,nan,nan,nan

Companies do better when there's a shortage of their products. Yes, increased manufacturing capacity means companies can make more products, but it also means they come down it price. To me, it's at least not clearly bullish.And asking why stocks are doing a certain thing on a given day is asking me to guess.",3,nan,nan,nan
