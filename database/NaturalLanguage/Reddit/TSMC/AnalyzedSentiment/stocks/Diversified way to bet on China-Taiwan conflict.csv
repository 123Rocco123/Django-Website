One move on Taiwan and China loses most of its semiconductor facility's and will be gimped for era's to come. Capturing Taiwan will lead to a large production bottleneck in the west, but it will lead to a complete standstill in China. All of its industries will only have huawei's crappy processors and essentially China will go back to 2014-2016.",2,nan,nan,nan

They have a mix of imported and domestic production. Without imported chips they’ll just rely on their own production. There might be a temporary hiccup, but it’s not the biggest worry. Their biggest worry would be a complete cut off of trade to North America and maybe Australia if they decide to throw in support. That would decimate the Chinese economy. Exporting to Europe and other regions won’t be enough to pick up the slack.",3,nan,nan,nan
