,"I have noticed that most people on here are very bullish towards Nvidia even at its current valuation but I haven't seen much talk about how Intel's return to the GPU market will affect Nvidia's valuation and future growth. Intel has the money and talent especially with Raja Koduri leading the Graphics department to become highly competitive with Nvidia if not a leader in the market. Intel will also have the advantage of using their new fabs in the future to produce their GPU's whereas Nvidia will be reliant on TSMC/Samsung. With AMD also becoming more competitive and both Intel and AMD not being as limited to just the GPU market unlike Nvidia, should people be worried that Nvidia may have to lower profit margins and suffer from lower growth that could make their current price look extremely high? For disclosure I do own some INTC and would be interested in NVDA if the valuation was more reasonable.","Nvidia isn't worried about intel because intel isn't trying to take on the GPU space the same way AMD does. intel wants discrete graphics first then low power consumption stuff mostly for laptops. They won't get any real market share in server or dedicated graphics for a long time. NVDA is still a great buy n hold stock, but if you own it get AMD too. That way, when one falls, the other rises.",0,nan,nan,nan

Their HPG GPU's for gamers and content creators and their HPC GPU's for data centers/server/AI. Of course it will take longer to gain market share in the data center/server compared to the consumer though as the consumer markets are very supply limited at the moment.I suppose it might depend on how much the graphics card market grows over the next few years if Nvidia can continue to grow as they are now despite losing some market share.,1,nan,nan,nan

But first of all: they're both ""too big to fail""Intel's GPU line doesn't have high expectations, at least in the consumer space. They're aiming at low to mid-range performance compared to AMD/Nvidia.That being said, their Ponte Vecchio SKU is doing better than expected, and is a datacenter part (highest of the high end, and with the most margins made) and is being installed in the new Aurora Supercomputer. You may be wondering why this goes against what I said about consumer parts, and that's because it's got HBM, foveros and a lot of different chips connected by it, so it's way too expensive to plausibly make/sell as a consumer part.Bottom line is don't bank on big revenue figures coming from GPU sales in the short-term, because consumer parts will be low to mid range and therefore short on margins, and server parts are slow to sell. They will be relatively good, and though they'll take time to gain market share, Intel has all the resources to not only make adoption fast and smooth for buyers, but also easy for developers to code for max efficiency (they've made a ""OneAPI"" that'll help with a lot of bottlenecks and inefficiencies, plus they're ahead of the curve with PCIe 5 and CXL). You'll see growth from this in about 1/1.5y from now. But it is pretty much garanteed (for both stocks, even)Edit: the one caveat is the impending recession, and the fallout that will pop bubbles and correct overvaluations now present. This will lead to some losses in the overall tech stock market. But as I've said first, both companies are too big to fail, so it's a matter of patience until their share prices regain and surpass their current value.",2,nan,nan,nan

They may scratch at the mid tier if the performance can sway the gamer / hobbyist market but imo, they're just going to raise the bar on the low end. Which Nvidia doesn't really have a stake in.The $500-1000 laptop space rarely has discrete GPU's because people buying those don't prioritize it. Would it be nice to have a dedicated GPU at that price point? Sure.If you're buying a $1500-$2000 laptop you can get a mid-high tier Nvidia GPU which will probably out perform the Intel Xe. Most likely Intel's part will be more efficient. Maybe more so in Windows 11. But if you look around, Intel isn't exactly known for their industry leading efficiency. Apple and ARM whip that ass. Intel's new 12th gen CPU set is pretty power hungry too.A lot of factors at play though. Price. Mining performance. Gaming performance. If they can provide NVidia 3060-3080 performance for a significantly lower price point, they'll take a bite out of Nvidia. But, by the time these roll around in 2022... Nvidia will probably be rolling out their 4000 series and mop the floor with everyone again.If Intel comes out with a bang and has RTX 3080 performance for say $499, with abundant inventory, they can definitely make a splash.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"I have noticed that most people on here are very bullish towards Nvidia even at its current valuation but I haven't seen much talk about how Intel's return to the GPU market will affect Nvidia's valuation and future growth. Intel has the money and talent especially with Raja Koduri leading the Graphics department to become highly competitive with Nvidia if not a leader in the market. Intel will also have the advantage of using their new fabs in the future to produce their GPU's whereas Nvidia will be reliant on TSMC/Samsung. With AMD also becoming more competitive and both Intel and AMD not being as limited to just the GPU market unlike Nvidia, should people be worried that Nvidia may have to lower profit margins and suffer from lower growth that could make their current price look extremely high?

With the new node they released just this month, they finally matched where AMD/TSMC have been for over a year, but AMD is already leapfrogging that in just two or three months with TSMC's 5nm and 4nm nodes.",2,nan,nan,nan

If Intel actually launches their 5nm node, uses TSMC for 3nm and then is able to transition to their own 3nm manufacturing being independent of TSMC will put Intel at a huge advantage.Also transistor size is quickly approaching theoretical limits. There is only a handful of generations left and then it will be left down to manufacturing capacity and optimization of existing node size (which historically Intel is pretty good at). If Intel is finally caught up in terms of node size with their own capacity while everyone else competes for TSMC capacity, then intel might be in a good position again.",3,nan,nan,nan

OEMs pushed out 84m client pcs this year.. those systems were mostly packing intel CPUs. Businesses that order with volume don’t want to support AMD based systems in their environment.Ppl on Reddit like AMD. They like the synthetic benchmarks, overclocks and FPS gainz that your eye can’t even see. They love to hear about the retail sales numbers (which is peanuts compared to OEM sales) .. all the things that don’t matter. Intel is a silicon giant..
