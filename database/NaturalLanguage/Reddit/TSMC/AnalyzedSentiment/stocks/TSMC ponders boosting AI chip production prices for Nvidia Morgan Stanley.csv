""We think NVIDIA's management recognizes TSMC’s reliability, as it helps remove one of the largest risk factors – foundry production,"" Chan added.NVIDIA did not confirm the timing or amount of a wafer price increase.TSMC hiked its prices by 10% in 2022 and another 5% in 2023. Morgan Stanley believes TSMC could raise prices by another 5% for 2025, due to AI semi demand. Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:2454-TK).""We believe TSMC will be a winner in AI semis in the long term,"" Chan noted. ""No matter where the growth is coming from – GPU or ASIC, cloud or edge AI chips – most, if not all, will likely be manufactured by TSMC's leading-edge foundry services.""Morgan Stanley rates TSMC Overweight, as most analysts are very bullish on the stock. Its price is up 55% year to date.","Sad this is the state of technology now. Guess it's always been this way to some extent, but feels like it's gotten way worse. All you can do is save money and use it to buy stock in multitrillion dollar companies.",5,nan,nan,nan
