I sold my NVDS right before earnings for a nice profit because anything could happen. Very glad I did.It's interesting because their AI business is booming while they crater the legacy graphics card business. I would bet the SP hits $400+ and possibly $500, and then melts away over the next 1 to 2 years as hype dies down, competitors catch up, AI training utilizes different platforms (already happening) and growth flat-lines. So basically they will pull a Tesla.At this point competitors and alternate training methods are their biggest risk.",4,nan,nan,nan
