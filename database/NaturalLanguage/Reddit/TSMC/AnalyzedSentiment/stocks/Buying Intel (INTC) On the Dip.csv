,"Is anyone else looking to buy intel on the dip? I think it will be a long term play as they will begin to outsource deigned to TSMC who makes a lot of AMD processors. ""The company (Intel) already announced a major shake-up of its technology team, including the removal of its chief engineering officer. It also outlined a contingency plan that could outsource some of its own future chip designs to TSMC. That would be a humbling move for a company that has long prided itself on its manufacturing prowess, but it also could negate the advantage that AMD enjoys using TSMC's leading-edge fabs."" - Dow Jones Newswires",I’m giving it a week or more to see where it goesI want to see if it stars to go up or bleed downI don’t want to buy a dead dog,0,nan,nan,nan

There’s still a lot of selling pressure on the stock though so there’s definitely a chance it’ll continue to go lower.",0,nan,nan,nan

It's pe is 8.8ish, it's 100% undervalued. It's not sexy so the upside is maybe limited, but it feels good. Not like buying Hertz bankrupt, but more what people were treating that as.",0,nan,nan,nan
