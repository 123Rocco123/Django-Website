,"I have the feeling that borders and economic isolation could become a bigger issue than we currently anticipate. Countries are realizing that there are irreconcilable differences in their political ideologies and that domestic production is crucial for security reasons. At first I obviosuly thought of the Russian market which is quite small and shouldn't concern us too much, but it seems like the current events are also escalating the fundamental differences between the US and China. An economic isolation of China would be a huge blow to companies that have a large customer base there. I am mainly thinking of everybodies darlings like AAPL or TSLA but also the other way around like BABA or even TSMC. Basically highly globalized companies whose revenue depend quite heavily on foreign markets. I am aware that this is a somewhat doomsday scenario but would enjoy your opinion on the topic!",Just checked: For example Google's China exposure is rather small - might be a good play at this point in time,0,nan,nan,nan

Also nothing new at coming. Plan on buying back but afraid it has a ways to go down. Half of me hope Iâ€™m wrong,0,nan,nan,nan
