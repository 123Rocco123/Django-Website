,"What’s everyone’s thoughts on AMD as a long term growth stock? After releasing their 2020 figures last week it looks like they are performing very well and they seem anything but over valued to me at their current pricing. ($85) With the 5nm Zen4 chips reportedly releasing this year that could also be another positive factor for a price rise considering their 7nm tech is far ahead of intel’s which is not yet in the market, and Nvidia plan to use TSMC for their tech. AMD also plan to release a new data centre processor and are on course to take more of the data centre market. Not to mention the ongoing shortage in their Semi-conductor GPU’s for Xbox and ps5. I’ve had it on my watchlist for a while and after the stock market volatility recently it’s surely a good buy tomorrow when the markets re-open. It seems like there will be more hype around GME tomorrow so I’m expecting to see a drop in loads of stocks tomorrow. Personally, I think AMD is a solid buy but I would like to hear thoughts from other folk.","I agree that they are not overvalued at $85, but I don't know if I would agree that it is undervalued. They were significantly undervalued a few years ago (what was it $15 a share?) and they definitely have made up the gap, or maybe even surpassed intel recently, but so has their share prices.",0,nan,nan,nan

With the new hardware that releases they can compete and out perform NVIDA and INTEL on some aspects which pushed them to where they are now. And until more amazing hardware is announced it'll stay the same price.,1,nan,nan,nan

They had amazing figures last week but went down 12% due to hedgefunds deleveraging because of you know what (can’t say the name apparently). Which means they are SHORT TERM undervalued. And the long term argument is there as well: They are growing in every segment in the market.,0,nan,nan,nan

Replicating TSMC is next to impossible. The moat is wide and deep like your mother.TSMC manufacture over half of the chips in the world. Very few electronic devices (from microwaves to vehicles) in the world that does not contain a TSMC chip.TSMC had foundry competition in earlier days, much less these days, no one on their scale. The only real competition is Samsung. Which is a strong competitor, one likely to come back again. TSMC has held its ground and pushed hard on R&D. Spent money on the best engineers and staff available.Intel stumbles on its own manufacture. Rumors of outsourcing some to TSMC.Semiconductor manufacture is a mix of chemical engineering, physics, and electronics. Very few can afford the equipment, and fewer can run the process.TSMC has one of the largest operating margins in the tech sector.Possible issues that could hurt TSMC- An extreme slow-down in tech. Very unlikely. Tech will IMO continue its exponential growth. Tech is not just the future, it is an omniscient presence.- The new EUV machines guzzle energy. The power company had to rush in new transformers for TSMC's factory because they are such power hogs. Taiwan actually has a power problem. There have been numerous outages. This is a looming crisis for the entirety of Taiwan. If they don't get their act together it could hurt TSMC in a big way.- Victim of their own success: where the tech has become so good that customers start saying you know what, this generation of chips is good enough for us, we will sit this one out and use the last-gen ones. And TSMC will have a problem recouping their R&D investment.https://daydaynews.cc/en/technology/833891.htmlhttps://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=2766The China issueBoth Bejing and Washington have recognized chips as a national security issue and geopolitical issue.China has recognized that for 20 years, but they are not that well-off in the semiconductor manufacture space. They are still struggling to get close to companies like TSMC.TSMC's view of the geopolitical situation is smart and diplomatic. Almost the same way they view their customer, they want to be the neutral supplier to everybody. They want to be everybody's foundry. ""We're in the camp of whichever client needs us."" They've taken this line for the longest time.Some people misunderstand TSMC because Taiwan is so close to China and because many electronic devices (in fact, most) are assembled in China. But the history and genesis of TSMC are far more American than it is Chinese. The two people who've held the chairmanship of TSMC both have American education and held/holds American citizenship. Founder Morris Chang attended Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. And the current one, Mark Liu, who started his career at Intel and AT&T Bell Labs.The style, the culture, and the process of TSMC are very American. The corporate governance approach. Very different from the way most Taiwanese companies are run. That culture TSMC has is very important. The clients, for the longest time, have been American.A much closer relationship to America than to China. Though, China is a very large chip buyer.As of now, 95-98% of TSMC's production capacity is in Taiwan. And of course, they have an upcoming factory in Arizona, US, but it will be of small scale (Samsung too, has a coming US factory).China says they will allow companies to sue other companies that comply with US sanctions. It seems that remaining neutral for TSMC will be difficult. They might be able to remain that forever. Have to choose sides.Huawei's situation the last couple of years should have been a wake-up call for TSMC management. The US said almost directly to TSMC that you shall not manufacture chips for Huawei. And they had to stop. Might open up again under a new administration in DC.TSMC has hired lobbyists to help their cause in DC. They might realize now that they cannot sit on this neutral fence forever, but they will try to hold on for as long as they can. And when they are forced to choose a side, they will choose the American. That's where their bread is buttered.My takeaway: Buy and hold TSM. I also have AMD and will hold. Thinking about buying Samsung, too.",5,nan,nan,nan
