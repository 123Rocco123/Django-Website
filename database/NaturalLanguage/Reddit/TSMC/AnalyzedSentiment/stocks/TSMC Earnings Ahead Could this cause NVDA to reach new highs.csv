Let’s discuss!",Both April and July earnings have followed the trend (at least for megacap tech) where they rally into earnings and then earnings don't meet huge expectation and then high valuation gets brought up and they sink. Both times have had Sp500 corrected roughly 10%. Can't imagine the trend reversing especially now that lower margins get brought up due to continuous purchasing of chips.,1,nan,nan,nan
