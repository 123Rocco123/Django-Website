Even if that was true, that means the immigrants are earning more and thus contributing more to the economy. How else would Canada even reach its current economic power without immigrants? More people live in Iraq than that place. And what country isn't in a housing crisis right now anyways, there are so many factors to this it's ridiculous to blame immigration for anything but a small portion for it.country brings in a huge flood of people that refuse to integrate into Canadian cultureAssimilation takes time, what's the issue here?

America, a nation with almost 10x the population, only has 1.2 million in total inflows for 2022. American immigration policy isn't even comparable on any level to Canada's borderline open borders. It is literally the stated goal of our government to increase our population to 100MM by 2100. Our 'conservatives' (not really like american cons at all) agree with the goal of 500k new citizens a year and don't plan to cut it if (when) they win the next election.We only have 2 cities anyone wants to live in and one of them (Vancouver) is boxed in by nature or borders in every direction. Even our most pathetic suburbs have houses running for near a million dollars. There's no plan to house any of these people and our economy is uncompetitive dogshit because all anyone invests in is luxury housing because why wouldn't you? The affordable 2nd tier cities like Calgary are becoming ludicriously expensive, with like a 40% rise in rent yoy. Petty crime is going absolutely apeshit, I work in trades and the number of garage doors people call me to fix up after sabotage or a break and enter is actually so insane I quit my job today to start my own company.I worked with a lot of boomers who've done very well for themselves and the degradation in QOL here is absolutely hilarious to hear about over the last 30 years. The last of them is quitting end of 2024ish because you'd have to be an idiot to work for the wages they're offering workers now.Finally, there's gonna be hardly any assimilation worth shit over time because the faster you bring people in the lower the rate of assimilation is. Richmond straight up has shops that don't have english on the regular menu anymore.
