,"After reviewing AMD's earning for two quarters in a row where their guidance exactly matched their earning, I have come to conclusion that this will continue for foreseeable future. The reasons are as follows: AMD does not have fab. TSMC manufactures processors for AMD, which requires multi months of lead time. This implies that AMD knows exactly how many processors will be manufactured ahead of time and how much they will sell for, hence exact match every quarters. AMD does not seem to want to wage price war with Intel since Intel has bigger war chest where both will suffer and AMD will suffer more. I believe AMD is content being one of the player in duopoly. So only thing to evaluate AMD is their guidance for the upcoming quarter and upcoming year. It is just OK, not spectacular. What do you think?","In house, you can make tweaks to increase yields to make more processors, but outsourced is fixed output. Outsourcer increasing yield will not result in more processor for the customer, just faster delivery.",0,nan,nan,nan
