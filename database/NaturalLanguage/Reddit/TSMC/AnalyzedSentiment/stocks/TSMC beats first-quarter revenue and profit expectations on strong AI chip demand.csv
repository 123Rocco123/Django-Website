,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications. Here are TSMC’s first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion. TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. “For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday. CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.” “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.” TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year. “TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results. TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market. “TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week. Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. “There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications. Here are TSMC’s first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion. TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. “For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday. CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.” “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.” TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year. “TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results. TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market. “TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week. Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. “There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

Also, in the era of smart factories, it just makes sense to produce products on site. If China blockades Taiwan, TSMC execs and engineers will be top candidates for covert U.S. extraction and the world will pour money into them to build new foundries. I would use a surprise China crisis to buy more shares overly discounted in a panic. Right now, they are the overwhelming leader in advanced chip production, and they keep their margins low to stay that way, making it very expensive for Intel and others to get into the foundry game and use healthy margins to expand. Intel was screwed by their last CEO, but they are far behind and it will take time for them to enter the game. TSMC has also always made the right decisions regarding architecture and tooling changes; they don't skimp on their internal research. If TSMC wanted to jack margins through the roof, they could, they are going to bump the prices of U.S.-made chips, but they are number 1 because they have protected their moat for decades. Importantly, they are making ASICs, which you need for energy-efficient LLM inference, with Grok, Google, and who knows who else making orders for their ASICs right now. I suspect Nvidia will announce state-of-the-art TSMC ASICs at next year's dev conference, because Jensen Huang knows what he is doing. TSM has very strong growth in their AI vertical.To top it off, though the U.S. economy is strong, the global economy sucks. Before GPT 3 took the market by storm, before LLM GPUs really mattered to the balance sheet, TSM earnings were ~22% higher than they were now. Their earnings on everything except the AI vertical will return to the the former highs when the global economy recovers and we start a new ~5-year semiconductor cycle, and the earnings will look a lot better with LLM GPUs and ASICs add to their phone and CPU revenue. They have a PE around 25, they have a dividend that they have historically bumped up quickly with earnings/price growth, though I wish they would spend it on ramping production instead. It's a better long-term call to spend that dividend money on producing more healthy-margin chips outside Taiwan, but their management is conservative. TSM should be a part of any long-term buy-and-hold account, though Wall Street traders probably won't pile on until they sniff out an imminent broader semiconductor rebound because the Street wants stellar growth in earnings and revenue right now before they convert a relatively low PE stock into a high-PE stock.",3,nan,nan,nan

TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. “For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday. CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.” “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.” TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year. “TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results. TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market. “TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week. Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. “There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications. Here are TSMC’s first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion. TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. “For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday. CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.” “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.” TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year. “TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results. TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market. “TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week. Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. “There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week. Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. “There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications. Here are TSMC’s first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion. TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. “For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday. CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.” “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.” TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year. “TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results.

The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results. TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market. “TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week. Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. “There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans. Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/tsmc-q1-2024-earnings-on-strong-ai-chip-demand.html","And why is the stock down then?

,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications. Here are TSMC’s first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion. TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. “For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday. CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.” “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.” TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips.
