,"From a broker: TSMC sees 10 days of excessive fabless inventory at end-2018 (deteriorating from 5 days excessive at 3Q18), which will only be digested back to normal in mid-2019. We thought the industry inventory correction had begun in 4Q18, but it appears 1Q19 should be officially the first quarter of inventory digestion. Historically, the industry takes at least two quarters to work down DOI to a near-term trough, so this means inventory correction will not be complete until June 2019 at the earliest, and could be even later depending on end demand. We knew that the inventory problem was severe, but what TSMC said today is even worse than what we thought. And from Nidec (mechanical component) CEO: “The plunge in orders in November and December was unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” founder and Chief Executive Officer Shigenobu Nagamori said at a briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. “All business segments were hit.” Also it looks like Nvidia still has a big inventory problem","Not great in the short term, but it might be a good opportunity to get in for the long haul. TSMC has established quite a dominance as fabs drop like flies.",0,nan,nan,nan
