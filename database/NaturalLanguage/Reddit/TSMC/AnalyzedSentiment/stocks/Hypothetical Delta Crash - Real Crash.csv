,"So Covid is indeed trending up again, even the US. Lets say this delta variant really starts taking hold in America and we get pandemic round 2. Sure the vaccine the vaccine, but Britain has decent vaccination and still getting rammed with Delta atm. so what do you guys think how do you play your hand? Liquidate now, wait for the crash and throw it on what? I was thinking of going big on UPRO & VTI. But what about ahead of time? Is there a window now to get in on biotech before a delta specific vaccine becomes mandatory? Any other plays like that that would make sense? If truly another shutdown type pandemic emerges again, perhaps that means doubling up on TSMC as semiconductors will be even that much more behind schedule. Trying to think outside the box but those were some of the biggest plays you could have made during the first crash right. Please share if there was a stock in particular you think now might be a good time to get in before pandemic version 2 comes, or a stock to maybe wait for it to crash then hop on that one. thanks","Britain has loads of delta cases. But a lot of these people testing positive don’t even have symptoms and the vast majority have super mild symptoms.So, the number of cases is largely irrelevant.The numbers of hospitalisations is the relevant number. This is 94% lower than the last time the covid case numbers were this high, because of the success of vaccination programs. So that means Covid is now 20x less severe than it used to be. That’s all you need to know, I think.The media and government really need to stop focusing on the case numbers and start focusing on the hospitalisations.",0,nan,nan,nan

Check how many Americans get flu each year, up to 20% of the population, but deaths are low so who cares.It’s the same now with covid and that’s just how it has to be if we want to return to any form of normal, lockdowns aren’t happening again unless we get a killer strain which kills 70% of infected.Fortunately evolution favours a weaker virus",1,nan,nan,nan

Seriously people are fed up and they just dgaf anymore. We cannot sustain another lock down not in the west at least. We aren’t an obedient people and we distrust the establishment.

Then it was like oh shit guys, theres actually a whole bunch of types of COVID. We built our vaccines around Alpha variant, which is what its 99% effective against. All vaccines are worse against Delta. None are 99%.Delta has been described by an infectious disease expert at the CDC as one of the most contagious diseases ever recorded. They used objective infectious measures, ie how much of the virus in how big of an area is likely to cause infection, how long does it incubate, how long is a person infectious for after harboring the virus etc.What happens when Delta mutates into Delta Beta? The logical hypothesis would be to say that Delta-Beta would be that much more elusive to the vaccine. Would it also be that much more contagious?This is a hypothetical thread mate. A lot of people are thinking like you and thats the point. There'd be some holes in the market if you were able to see the future ahead of time before everyone else. You're going to sound nutty to people when you're ahead of the curve. I understand you could also be flat wrong but thats the point of discussion.",1,nan,nan,nan

Pick stocks that are bullish in either case, if you can find any. You want to make money if we keep going up, and even more money if we crash and burn. Don’t just factor in the crash though- factor in another round of stimulus- that will make it easier. I’d keep some powder dry maybe, I’ve stopped depositing to my brokerage and started padding my bank account, but I’m not pulling out of my positions- I’m staying bullish on my picks and the S&P but cautiously bearish on the Russell, and watching for the S&P to roll over in the next few months- if we go down hard we’ll recover hard again too- I’ll bag-hold if I’m not online to market sell when the first circuit breaker trips, and I’ll go bullish on the S&P with my reserve cash after the initial dip.",0,nan,nan,nan
