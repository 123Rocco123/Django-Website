,"I know. It's red, everything went down for quite a lot and you might have lost a lot of money today, or did you?? Just as you don't win anything until you cash out on your move, you don't lose anything until: The company you invested into goes bankrupt and liquidates your shares (extremely rare, predictable and easily avoidable if you're keeping up with news). You cash out your loss. So, do not panic sell! The market will recover, even if it's going to take 1 week or a couple of months up to a year, it will happen at some point. If you don't need the money right now, just keep it invested, and also buy some more when it drops further. I saw a bunch of people today dumping, out of fear of a new recession wave, everything they had, including stocks at Microsoft, Delta, TSMC. Those companies aren't going anywhere! Even Delta has piles of cash to burn through for more than a year and the Feds are printing an loaning like crazy, and with close to zero interest on top of it. Yes, the market was overpriced for the current economic, but that doesn't mean it won't be back up later on. I will and it is only a matter of time.

Try to remember and invest by his following quote: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.""","I follow the principle of ""averaging"" my investment.Instead of worrying and trying to catch the bottom of the curve (which is pretty hard to impossible to actually predict in most cases), I tend to invest in chucks along the way.For example: I got some more shares of MSFT recently at 184, then 186, then 188, instead of going all in on a certain price point. I did the same for TSMC. Got some at 55, then 56/57, now I got some more at 55, the average cost being around 55.60. So I'm green overall due to averaging, even though I made some ""bad"" calls on the 57 high.Spreding out might not give you the same returns as a lucky bottom hit, but it's less risky and less prone to volatility.",1,nan,nan,nan
,"I know. It's red, everything went down for quite a lot and you might have lost a lot of money today, or did you??

Try to remember and invest by his following quote: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.""","Actually, I normally would agree with this post. But I suggest selling at least half of your stocks (also depends on multiple reasons). I have had many traveling stocks like AAL and CCL, but I decided to sell it all. I bought AAL when it was only $7. I will again rebuy if it hits that market again. I made a pretty decent earning from it and settled for it. This is because strictly traveling will not be continued for the rest of 2020 and has been official, but not publicly announced yet. This includes all cruises and limited flights. I really wish I could agree with this post and say to hold on to your stocks. But know when you are also getting greedy. This is not the time. It will be a rocky way back up and wouldn’t suggest any travel stocks just yet. Hoping by a few months we can again rebuy these lost stocks. Maybe (options) calls and puts would be a better fit for this situation instead. 100% all travel stocks will go down (hint hint).",0,nan,nan,nan

Valuations are 20 year high, imagine writing this in 2000 before the tech bubble bursts. What many people are noticing is the divergence between stocks and the real world economy, this is concerning and we don't know how this ends.
