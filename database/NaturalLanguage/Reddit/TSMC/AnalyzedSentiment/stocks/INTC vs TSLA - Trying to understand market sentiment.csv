So even if IFS could earn $50B a year, if 70% of its clients are INTC itself, it only leaves $15B available for external clients. This will mean that TSMC won't feel as threatened.This is great for INTC chip design but I don't feel comfortable staying with x86 designs when the future is clearly shifting towards ARM / RISC-V and GPUs.

INTC is down about 55% while their competition has been reaching new highs almost every year.What's worse is there was a period, at least for a decade, when INTC held market advantage. What did they do? They squandered it by practically halting R&D on their biggest manufacturing obstacles.INTC once had moats, but they no longer hold the exclusive partnerships like they used to for being THE CPU manufacturer for vendors. Sure, they won the desktop budget enthusiast class with Alder Lake, but think about that for a second. How many enthusiasts are willing to cheap out for a 12100?Quick Sync no longer allows INTC to corner the media market. AMF / VCN and NVENC now exist.Their GPUs are trash. They win the CPU market at the very highest end, but the most popular CPUs are the middle of the road, where AMD has always been chipping away at INTC.We don't even need to mention A.I. We'd have to be blind to not know who's been slaughtering that sector, and it certainly isn't INTC.The problem with INTC is your big if.

Lies that are easily disproven by a simple Google search.Intel entering the GPU space is a decade too late if not two. Intel has no experience making good drivers and drivers is all the rage. Their GPUs so far has been beyond pathetically weak and a insult to the market. They've had to sell them at a loss to love inventory and that won't change.Meanwhile their CPUs are also lagging, hard. And despite several years of trying they simply are unable to catch up. Even with a good CEO it'll take many years and even so they'll never get on par as long as their competitors blaze on forward.

They were large, but their major competitors on all fronts (AMD for CPUs, NVDA for GPU's/Datacenter, and TSM for chipsets) have become larger (by market cap) and only AMD makes less money (but is in the weaker sector, client computing). It sits as slightly more volatile than the normal market (1.21) but has underperformed the S&P for the last 1, 3, and 5 years (although it was doing better in the last year until the sell-off).It makes no compelling arguments to own it as an individual stock vs a basket (S&P or QQQ) other than a slight increase on the dividend of 1.46 vs 1.28 (not enough to impact decisions).

Not sure how long you've been following the markets, but TSLA skyrocketed during the 2020-2021 COVID/zero-interest-rate/stimulus era. It was probably the most talked about stock on Reddit, tons of people made fortunes YOLOing call options on TSLA. When Tesla announced a stock split in August 2020, the stock skyrocketed up ~50% over the course of a couple weeks. That has nothing to do with the fundamentals and everything to do with being a meme stock.Now of course things have come back down to earth a bit, but TSLA is still quite a bit of a meme stock and it's best not to read too much into the price swings.",0,nan,nan,nan

It has been dumping recently. Just in December it was at $250 a share. TSLA most likely bounced on poor earnings due to the amount of short interest in the stock. If you haven’t heard of market manipulation then you need to do some research. Theres a reason why good earnings don’t equal a jump in stock price and bad earnings don’t equal a dump in stock price.

I mean Intel has been a major fab since the 1980s (top 10 in 1987). And they still have a bunch of old fabs around.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_manufacturing_sitesAnd the main thing about Intel fabs is what % yield efficiency at the 3nm level? They can get some decent chips at low % yield, but then it becomes costly. People here somehow think that ASML tech is plug and play...Add on: I mean, Intel didn't even bother switching to mobile devices and let that market completely open. They had first dips from Apple to be their sole provider and turned it down, letting Samsung and TSMc to start dominating.And heres my question for you, whats the CEO of Intel's vision for the company? They are trying to compete with specialized companies (AMD/NVidia for design, and TSMC and Samsung for fabs.).

Almost all current cars are dependent on oil. Another technology that does not require oil to run must be invented. Here comes the electric vehicle. Tesla is the leader by far, and is the ONLY manufacturer that is making a profit making them (very important). Tesla is also making everything else that is conducive to a global scalable non fossil fuel dependent energy system. In summary, Tesla is a company that is fundamentally making products that must grow in order for us Humans to thrive, which means Tesla MUST grow long term. By long term, think AT LEAST 30 years from now. Tesla must and will grow long term which means Tesla stock to the moon.Intel has several competitors that are already making better and cheaper products currently, unless they come back from this somehow, it's over if the gvt decides at some point or another to stop financing them.",0,nan,nan,nan

Regardless of all future promises from either side, of which there are many, Intel is losing market share to its technologically superior competitors, i.e., AMD and NVDA, right now. AMD's cpu margins are much higher. AMD's cpu's are much simpler and cheaper to build. Intel seems like legacy auto, only achieving parity with AMD by building complex, expensive monstrosities with massive power consumption.For Tesla, I think the earnings call (for analysts) was less about FSD but more about a path forward for increased auto sales in the medium term, which had disappeared from the Tesla story before this point.",0,nan,nan,nan
