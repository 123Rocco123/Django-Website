Sure it's not sexy or new or fun, but they have a hell of a product line that's insulated by staggering barriers to entry.Like many other stocks, MSFT ""breathes"" as it climbs. Last time it was at a full inhale, it hit ~230. IMO buy it up at full exhale (just below ~200) and you'll be fine. Or not, it's the stock market, who knows.",0,nan,nan,nan

I don't even think there is an ""actual"" value for a company.Discounted cash flow valuation requires that you project what their future cash flows will be then discount them at some %.So already we have two big problems.What should the discount rate be? We're in a 0% world.Cost of debt is easy enough - if the company issues debt, which all companies typically do, it's reported in their 10K.But cost of equity? Risk free rate is 0% yet you don't see share prices skyrocketing proportionally, so the basic model of discounted cash flows is broken if we don't see a large move upwards.Then projected cash flows - it's hard enough guessing cash flows in the next year, how can you project them for the indefinite future?Did people project a huge uptick in MSFT's cash flows over a decade ago? No they did not, otherwise the stock price wouldn't have been so cheap.So the better way to go about it, IMO, is to not try to find the ""actual"" value of the company, but assume that the current price is correct.Then after that, determine what current expectations are.Then after that, guess (we're all guessing here) whether the expectations will be correct or not.Some expectations:Interest rates will be low for a long time. If you think there will be a sudden hike, then you should not be holding stocks.AMD growth will be huge. If you think Intel will make a comeback like they did with the core 2 processor in 2006, then you would not invest.MSFT rides on Azure. If you think AWS, GCP or other vendors will disrupt their growth, then you would not invest.I think it's easier to invest in that way than trying to find an ""actual"" value.",0,nan,nan,nan

They are all solid companies just I don’t feel comfortable with the rate they have rallied.If it was all based on TA I don’t see them going down much further without drastic news. AMD has a huge gap below $75 dollars.You need to figure out your time table. Is this an investment or a trade ( big difference).

If you firmly believe in the company and what they are doing and their long term outlook it usually makes more since to just buy it and 5-10 years from now the few dollars you might of missed is outweighed by getting in earlier and holding.

If they manage to do the company ""overhaul"" that they want to, it could end up as a massive turnaround.AMD feels overvalued to me because of their rapid growth, and the P/E is of course not very low. If they manage to massively raise their EPS I'll throw down some more for them.
