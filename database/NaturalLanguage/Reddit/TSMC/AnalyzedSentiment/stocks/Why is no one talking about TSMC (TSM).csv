,"Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and many others made their chips at TSMC ($TSM) or Global founderies. Very low debt levels, healthy financials and 4% dividend yield. Seems like an undervalued stock. Or is this one a value trap?!","nah it's a good stock, the dip is because the whole corona thing. I am waiting for a bigger dip to jump on it. Once the corona things goes away, Apple and every other tech will raise again, which means tsm will also rise again.",0,nan,nan,nan

Nvidia's chips are made at TSMC. Apple's chips are made at TSMC. Buying TSMC is going to let you ride the wave on all those tech companies.You're right it's a good stock. It's just not time to buy yet.",0,nan,nan,nan
