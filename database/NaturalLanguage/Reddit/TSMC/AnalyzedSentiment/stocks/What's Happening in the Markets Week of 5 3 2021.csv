,"Hi Everyone! Here is my Monday Newsletter :) Happy trades and please DM me with any questions you may have :) Week of 5/3/21 The S&P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21. Manufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit & factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity & labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings. The average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM. Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd. Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...[take] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...” The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.
