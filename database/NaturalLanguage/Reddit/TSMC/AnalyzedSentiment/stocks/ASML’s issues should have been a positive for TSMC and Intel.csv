,"If the China export restrictions are the primary cause for ASML’s weakness, then that must mean that TSMC and Intel will have an easier time acquiring ASML machines.

It’s the reason TSMC has not invested heavily into high NA EUV machines because they are simply too expensive to make sense economically right now.

Therefore, the analysts were wrong.

Nothing to do with access to ASML machines.",0,nan,nan,nan

Therefore, the analysts were wrong. They should have saw this and bought up TSMC and Intel instead of selling all semiconductor stocks after ASML’s report.","As a relative insider I can say that the Dutch government was not specifically forced. They negotiated a deal in which Intel and the TMSC US plants, backed by the US Chips act, cover a significant part of the Chinese revenue in the next five years. Since those investments are delayed, it seems that 2024 and 2025 revenue will be below guidance but long-term should not be an issue. The CMD in November will make that perfectly clear.",3,nan,nan,nan
,"If the China export restrictions are the primary cause for ASML’s weakness, then that must mean that TSMC and Intel will have an easier time acquiring ASML machines. One of the biggest costs for chip fabs is the machines. It’s the reason TSMC has not invested heavily into high NA EUV machines because they are simply too expensive to make sense economically right now. With nearly half of ASML’s market wiped out over night, TSMC and Intel should have a much easier time securing these machines faster and at a lower price due to less competition. Therefore, the analysts were wrong. They should have saw this and bought up TSMC and Intel instead of selling all semiconductor stocks after ASML’s report.",There is no way Intel and TSMC US plants can cover the whole demand of EUV machines from China.,4,nan,nan,nan

There are way more appliances in lithography, including older models like DUV and immersion for more basic chips (which China produces in bulk).",5,nan,nan,nan
