,"Those 3 companies contribute about ~30% of their revenue. I only started reading about them today. However isnt there a bit of a chip race going on right now towards 7nm, and 5nm? AMAT should benefit from it and hasn't skyrocketed like TSMC. They also don't seem to be impacted heavily by covid. Earnings coming up on Thursday. They trade at a 20 PE which seems reasonable, however it is historically high for them as they are used to 13-17 PE. Earnings and revenues are bouncy but generally are trending up Thoughts? Any shareholders wanna explain why they hold?",Seems like a safe bet short term for sure. I wouldn’t expect a huge pop since they’ve already returned to pre Covid levels.,0,nan,nan,nan

Railroads too (UNP) recovered to pre covid yet theyve taken a major ~25% hit to rev and earnings recently",1,nan,nan,nan

They are taking at about 21 P/E right now, but as they build out their portfolio, they expect to earn over $5/sh with increased margins. So, a FPE of closer to 7. AMAT is a great company, but they are already built out. ONTO has that TAM SAM gap to fill in addition to eating market share and the growing industry. I wouldn't be shocked if AMAT or LRCX buys ONTO, frankly. It would make sense.",0,nan,nan,nan

And with pattern control software with machine learning, they provide an end to end solution. So if Intel or Western Digital want to survive in their competitive marketplaces, they need to have the best tools to print the wafers. They are a small company, but they are #1 or #2 in their core markets. They win because they have the best tools.",2,nan,nan,nan

The other 10% is the actually engineering and production. The amount of Fortune 500 company customers also doesn’t hurt anything. Definitely a long term hold",0,nan,nan,nan
