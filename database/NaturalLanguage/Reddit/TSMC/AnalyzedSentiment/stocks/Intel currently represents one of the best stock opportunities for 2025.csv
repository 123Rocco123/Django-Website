,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",Inversing the Reddit hivemind is a winning strategy.

Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning.

,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580.

Sometimes following the cult makes you money sometimes it makes you lose all your money...it is a whole other aspect of valuation that is really stupid and lame but can potentially make people money who buy into the hype (or think they can make money off others buying into the hype and then selling before them) and it can have nothing to do with the actual realistic value of the company. Tesla hasn't done useful shit in years and their competition increases every year lol. They bragged about self driving cars but could never deliver...meanwhile I take a waymo whenever I need a ride in central los angeles and those things are fantastic. There is no part of the market they already had that they haven't lost ground on and they pumped up their stock selling things they can't do and in the meantime other people are actually beating them at it. I would have sold tesla then too (and lost a lot of potential profit!) because they are getting closer and closer to a vaporware company lol. I don't shit on anybody who made a fortune off their stock but I do shit on anybody who thinks that company is worth the valuation they get based on actual performance...what have they done lately? had some moronic pep rallies and released the literal stupidest vehicle on earth that they can't even sell in half of the wealthy western world? They are turning into a complete joke. Everybody has ridden in a million teslas because uber rental car companies bought a shit ton of them years ago to rent to drivers...nobody is impressed by the ipad on wheels anymore and the seats aren't even comfortable. They had a moment where they could have gotten HUGE and their ceo decided to do ketamine and search for himself on the website he bought all day and night and then bark orders on his drug comedowns and drug highs and destroyed any opportunity to make the brand a hugely dominant player in the auto market long term.,2,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",Who thought Meta was dying and when?

Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.","“They don’t have the culture to see around the corner, and therefore they’ll continue to lose” is really compelling.

The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",logic,1,0.5,POSITIVE,0.996
,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities.

I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.","Forward PE is 27, January earnings will be better than Broadcom",3,0.563,NEGATIVE,0.95

While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning.

Could it hit $30 and become a 50% gain? Possibly.Is it going to keep growing and be a good stock to hold into retirement? Not very likely.Look at all the big semiconductor space stocks of the past decade or so. NVDA AMAT QCOM AVGO ASML LRCX TXN ADI ASML KLA AMD. They completely obliterated the performance of INTC. Point I'm trying ot make is saying INTC is a bad investment isn't necessarily saying the company is crashing and burning and is worthless. It just means there are many other more attractive options out there.Now you have to ask yourself, do you want to gamble that INTC could have a little run-up based on valuation, but they have no track record of sustaining the capital appreication? Or do you want to invest and hold solid companies that grow year after year. People holding these and other tech stocks are setting up their retirements. You might luck out on a swing trade on INTC and then what? If I'm not mistaken, INTC has jumped from $18-20 to $22-24 range multiple times in the past few months. Good luck with that. I'll hold the solid stocks long term and let them grow my wealth for me.",0,0.553,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere.

,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning.

AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.","Great breakdown-thanks for sharing! I agree Intel seems undervalued, especially trading below bosk value. Their $50B in annual revenue and healthy debt-to-equity ratio show the company is still in a strong position financially.The 18A progress is especially promising. If Intel can hit industry-standard yields, the foundry business could be a game changer. The Amazon Al chip deal might just be the start, and geopolitical factors like tariffs could make Intel even more competitive against TSMC. There is also the wild card of an chinese attack on TaiwanThe OEM dominance and improving CPU/GPU lineup are also solid points. Sure, AMD is strong in gaming, but intel’s overall market share and product roadmap give it room to recover.However execution will be key, especially with leadership changes.

Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead.

Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets.

And I was someone who said Intel at $18-19 is worth a speculative gamble as a dumpster dive.However let’s Devil’s advocate some of your pitch.1 - the previous buyers at $18-19 were like myself, buying with little conviction other than seeing a distress sale we could flip for $23-24. But back then, Intel had a narrative of being “America’s chip maker”. Since then, that story has gotten a bit muddier. There’s concerns about how much government welfare that will entail, and whether the incoming administration will continue such long term infrastructure investing versus backroom deals and midnight mergers. There’s a lot of picking winners and losers mentality, and the simplified narrative that grants and business loans are just undesirable handouts.2 -Insolvency worries are your own thing from the sounds of it. The collapse was due to obvious signs of poor leadership, shrinking everything, lack of competitiveness, etc. A company doesn’t need to be insolvent for the stock to crash. It just needs to have more sellers than buyers.3 - foundry isn’t a guaranteed winning area, and is a long way out4 - investors have been burned over and over with promises of “pc refresh” that always disappoint. And even if that ever happens, AMD is a formidable (and some might say dominant) competitor. So if someone does have faith in pc and server, why not go with best in breed (amd)5 - this sounds like a game or something? If so it’s got to be so niche that it can’t possible move the needle. I recall back to a time when Intel did a similar thing. They developed their own on board 3D graphics. I think it was called i740 or something. Hopefully a computer person will correct me. Well, their economy version of a gpu did about 80-90% of what 3dfx and Nvidia could do, and it was a $10 add on for mainboard makers. That should have killed off competitors like Nvidia who were trying to charge $200 for only marginally better product. Look how that turned out.6 - I’m not in the space but even I know Intel has been failing and flailing in their product developments like what you describe. And that was back when they still had good people. There’s been an exodus of the genuises needed. And the top recruit would not be lining up to join Intel.Technical mastery and vision is critical. Lisa Su and Jensen Huang know that. They attract it and cultivate it, and the results have been obvious.Tariff tantrums don’t happen in isolation. Even if we don’t challenge your description of a benefit (which I don’t necessarily agree with, but let’s just say for argument it’s real) then it will come with other problems that will more than offset.A savings as you describe won’t matter anyway. The market can get AMD’s cheap Temu style AI chips, but there’s a reason they’d rather wait and pay $25k, $35k, $40k for Nvidia’s instead. For them it’s not about raw price, it’s about getting what the want.Ask someone who is begging to get more allocation from Nvidia right now if they’ll pay 20% more to jump the line. They’d do it in a second.8 - That theory isn’t backed by evidence. Nvidia has years of order backlog and no customers is canceling because they know there’s ten others who will slurp up that allocation instantly. They want what Nvidia has, and price isn’t the issue. Someday that will change, but that’s not today.So with all that in mind, some suggest there’s kind of a pecking order. You have best of breed Intel GPU/AI. You have Broadcom’s asic alternatives. Next you have AMD. But if the number 1 and number 2 options are still public, why go down the food chain for something that’s below top 3?",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",value trap,0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.984

This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields.

Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs.

While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable.

,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case.

With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line.

Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support.

,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.","TSMC’s US fabs will only have a capacity of 600,000 wafers per year. The first fab in Arizona is only cranking out about 20,000 a month.TSMC’s other fabs have a capacity of 16,000,000 wafers.Their US fabs don’t make enough chips and they are older process technologies than what they have in Taiwan.",1,0.552,NEGATIVE,0.999

Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs.

The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable.

I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong). Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",Grandma begs to differ,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.996
