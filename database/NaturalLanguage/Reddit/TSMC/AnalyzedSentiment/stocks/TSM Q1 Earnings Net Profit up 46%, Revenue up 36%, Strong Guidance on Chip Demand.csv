TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc supplier, reiterated on Thursday that it expected chip capacity to remain very tight this year, a shortage that has forced automakers and electronics manufacturers to cut production. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) forecast revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.2 billion in the quarter ending June 30, up from $13.29 billion a year earlier. The company expects chip demand to continue in the long term and was working with customers to mitigate shortages, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told an online earnings briefing, calling it a ""mega-trend"" in the industry supported by demand for 5G and artificial intelligence, as well as an increase in chips used in gadgets. TSMC is working to address supply chain challenges with tool suppliers, he added, referring to a cycle of shortages where makers of chip equipment are struggling to find the chips needed for equipment to supply chipmakers like TSMC. The company, which also has customers such as Qualcomm Inc , has previously said it expected strong growth to accelerate in coming years due to robust demand for chips that power everything from smartphones to cars. It has already lifted capital spending for this year. The company on Thursday said net profit for the January-March quarter jumped 45% from a year earlier to T$202.7 billion ($7 billion). Analysts expected a profit of T$184.67 billion, according to an average of 19 estimates compiled by Refinitiv. The first quarter was supported by better-than-expected demand from smartphone customers and high performance computing chips, as well as strong demand for auto related chips, Wei said. Revenue climbed 36% to $17.57 billion, beating market expectations, and above the company's own estimated range of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-tsmc-forecasts-q2-sales-054154312.html https://investor.tsmc.com/english/quarterly-results/2022/q1","So those Barclays analysts were spouting bullshit about declining demand?

It has been that way for forever. Look at the charts for all semis. They've had massive runups over the last 2 years. What everyone is worried about is that there is going to be a gigantic glut of inventory building up due to all of the buildout and efforts to boost production to meet the current shortage. There could be an overshoot of supplies and a glut of chips and capacity forms. If a glut happens, it will send prices cratering, which means a contraction in earnings for semi companies going forward. A big glut happened before a while back and it tanked the sector for a very long time.Now if you are an ever optimist, you could point to the fact that the world will keep demanding more and more chips due to the fact that we are in a new industrial revolution and glut fears may never pan out. Increased demand in the future has been priced in, so how much more can semis go up? No risk, no rewards I suppose.

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc supplier, reiterated on Thursday that it expected chip capacity to remain very tight this year, a shortage that has forced automakers and electronics manufacturers to cut production.

But now as economies reopen, the spending starts re-balancing toward services, reducing demand for electronics and hence semiconductors. More importantly, higher inflation would likely reduce discretionary spending too, which could also weigh on semiconductor demand in 2H22. Enterprise and Datacenter customers react more slowly than consumers in adjusting spending pattern, but bears are betting some time in 2H22 they would cut the demand forecast as well.If semiconductor demand is on the down-cycle, it's better to sell stocks early than late. That being said, a lot of semi names have seen significant share price correction with their prices on 2-year moving averages. It's probably a good time to review the fundamentals and start bargain hunting.",2,nan,nan,nan
