,I'm curious on how the foreign value of a stock relates to the domestic value. For example for TSMC seems to have similar history as its Taiwanese counterpart but it seems that the US based stock is growing faster than the Taiwanese traded. I was wondering if they have some kind of correlation I was missing.,Currency translation,0,nan,nan,nan

The NYSE tends to discourage low priced stocks. Thus, adjustments are made for the US market.",1,nan,nan,nan

So even though they are both on different stock exchange both are owning rights to the same company and thus if one goes down the other one should as well?,1,nan,nan,nan

Gets more difficult than a straight comparisy.Suppose a US company wants to Buy the foreign company... It may rise in price here Before it does there... that's a matter of liquidity. But you could also export $$ (forex) and buy it on the overseas market... Eventually it would equalize. Or there could be even more foreign exchange manipulation involved.",2,nan,nan,nan

It’s fairly stable, but if the US dollar strengthens against the Taiwan dollar, your shares will look more valuable because you are profiting on the change in the exchange rate. If the dollar weakens, your shares, priced in dollars, will also weaken.In effect you are adding a new risk by buying it in US dollar denominations: currency risk.",2,nan,nan,nan
