,"The Biden administration is expected to award billions of dollars in subsidies to top semiconductor companies, including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . (TSMC), in the coming weeks to help build new factories in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. The forthcoming announcements are aimed at kick-starting manufacturing of advanced semiconductors that power smartphones, artificial intelligence and weapons systems, the WSJ reported, citing industry executives familiar with the negotiations. The executives expect some announcements to come before U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on March 7, the WSJ report added. Among the likely recipients of the subsidies, Intel has projects underway in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon that will cost more than $43.5 billion, the Journal said. TSMC has two plants under construction near Phoenix for a total investment of $40 billion. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, also a contender, has a $17.3 billion project in Texas. Micron Technology , Texas Instruments and GlobalFoundries count among other top contenders, WSJ said, citing industry executives. The U.S. Department of Commerce, Intel, and TSMC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. In December 2023, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she would make around a dozen funding awards for semiconductor chips within the next year, including multibillion-dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production. The first award was announced in December, of over $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire to produce chips for fighter planes, part of a $39 billion “Chips for America” subsidy program approved by the U.S. Congress in 2022.",10 Billion for convincing Taiwanese engineers to move to the US and get those fabs moving?,0,nan,nan,nan

Therefore Intel has to stay top dog within designing in order to subsidise their American plant operations, its a losing game. Look how much better AMD did since they span off their fabs and focused on design.I guess my point is, Intel has already moved to IFS (Intel Foundry Services), which splits their fabrication business off into its own unit. If Intel sees the writing on the wall in American semiconductor manufacturing (without the CHIPS act, the writing is on the wall already) then Intel sells that unit and it goes under. Suddenly the US is in an extremely fragile geopolitical postion, like being stuck without Oil access before WW2. They gonna pump money into Global Foundries??

TSMC has two plants under construction near Phoenix for a total investment of $40 billion. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, also a contender, has a $17.3 billion project in Texas. Micron Technology , Texas Instruments and GlobalFoundries count among other top contenders, WSJ said, citing industry executives. The U.S. Department of Commerce, Intel, and TSMC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. In December 2023, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she would make around a dozen funding awards for semiconductor chips within the next year, including multibillion-dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production. The first award was announced in December, of over $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire to produce chips for fighter planes, part of a $39 billion “Chips for America” subsidy program approved by the U.S. Congress in 2022.",Imagine being a taxpayer and see you hardearned cash go to a major tech multinational that only cares about it's dividend and stock growthProblem with producing in the US is it's insane labour costs compare to TSMC counterpart. Taiwanese labours make insane hours with high productivity. Doubt the US can mimic this.,0,nan,nan,nan
,"The Biden administration is expected to award billions of dollars in subsidies to top semiconductor companies, including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . (TSMC), in the coming weeks to help build new factories in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. The forthcoming announcements are aimed at kick-starting manufacturing of advanced semiconductors that power smartphones, artificial intelligence and weapons systems, the WSJ reported, citing industry executives familiar with the negotiations. The executives expect some announcements to come before U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on March 7, the WSJ report added. Among the likely recipients of the subsidies, Intel has projects underway in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon that will cost more than $43.5 billion, the Journal said. TSMC has two plants under construction near Phoenix for a total investment of $40 billion. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, also a contender, has a $17.3 billion project in Texas.

They offset labor costs to allow us production to compete with foreign production,1,nan,nan,nan
