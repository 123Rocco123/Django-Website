,"The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products.

Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years.

These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share.

A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways.

These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways.

Such tectonic shifts - if real - can take a very long time.There used to be a saying ""nobody ever got fired for picking IBM"". It took decades for that rule to fade. The same is true of Intel. AMD may indeed be crushing it on tech, and winning customers one at a time. But it will take a long time for Intel to lose their dominance, even if it's warranted.Keep in mind the just had a blowout quarter. Companies pay them $73 billion a year for what is essentially melted sand.Perhaps their blowout is due to low analyst expectations. But that's a condition that can take a quarter or two to rectify as the analysts gradually tweak their recommendations and targets to levels where Intel will struggle or miss. That means they could beat again next quarter.They now have a permanent CEO who is a numbers guy, who reported is working for peanut salary with a strong incentive to crank those numbers.Your diagnosis is they've lost their way in product architecture and design and innovation. I won't argue as I wouldn't know and your case sounds plausible. If so, then they probably have the wrong CEO since he doesn't sound like he'd be the inspiring voice to revive the product innovation.I sense the author is a die hard AMD fan, which is fine. But AMD having a cooler product doesn't necessarily put Intel out of business. Coke and Pepsi continue to punch the clock every day so they can fight each other. And AMD's multiple is so out of whack that they probably need to torque up earnings by cranking up sales, but any moves they make on price or competitiveness won't be as a monopoly; they'll be done with Intel fighting them for every inch.To me that means even if your theory of AMD taking the crown from Intel is happening, it will be a slow moving coup.",0,nan,nan,nan

During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something.

A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”.

Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years.

When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (slide, can't add the image) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.
