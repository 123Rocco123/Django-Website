A chinese company that produces equipment for produce chips Thanks,Not at the moment there was a company that stole company secrets but failed to competete non the less.In China's 2025 plan they plan to produce these machines themself.If they succeed is another question i believe they can if the government writes a blank check,0,nan,nan,nan

Plus all ASML competitors are apparently within the scope of the Wassenaar Arrangement (HQ'd in the US/NL), and do not even compare in terms of EUV technology. But it's very likely that a Chinese counterpart will emerge.Would that ban be lifted soon after the Trade Deal maybe? That order seems to just be on a temporary hold at the discretion of the Dutch government.",0,nan,nan,nan
