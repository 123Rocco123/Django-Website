,"Intro This is my short and condensed KISS (keep it stupid simple) review of ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd ($ASX). The basics covers some of the fundamentals, with the figures benchmarked against ASE Technology‚Äôs largest indirect competitor - TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited) - as indicated by ‚Äòvs.‚Äô. Keep in mind that ASE is not a manufacturer of semiconductors. They specialize in assembly and testing, which happens in the final stages of production. TSMC specializes in the early stages of semiconductor production as a manufacturer. They are however both key players in the same industry. Why am I using TSMC as a benchmark instead of comparing against industry averages? Because you don‚Äôt benchmark against ‚Äòaverage‚Äô, you benchmark against the top performers in the same industry. The points made inside the bearish and bullish arguments are my interpretations of the company and stock. The summary is my attempt of bringing everything together. I invite you to totally destroy my DD with your best arguments so we can further debug the analysis on this stock. Let‚Äôs go! Basics Company: ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. HQ: Kaohsiung, Taiwan [1] Industry: Semiconductor assembly, testing & packaging [1] Company Description: Provider of independent semiconductor assembling and test manufacturing services. [1] Exchange: NYSE Ticker: ASX vs. TSM Price:  $8.31 vs. $136.66 [2][3]  Market Cap: 17.3B vs. 604.9B [2][3]  Avg Trading Volume: 2M vs. 11.7M [2][3]  Short % of Shares Outstanding: 0.14% vs. 0.27% [4][5] Institutional Shares: 0.03% vs. 89.29% [6][7] 3 Month Price Returns: 60.74% vs. 41.46% [8][9] PE Ratio: 26.81 vs. 61.28 [2][3]  P/B Ratio: 2.26 vs. 10.69 [10][11]  3 Year Net Income Growth: 43.06% vs. 5.23% [12][13] Debt to Equity Ratio: 1.26 vs. 0.00 [14][15] Industry Average Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03 [16] Bearish Arguments Europe wants to develop its own chip industry. Taiwan can expect competition if Europe pushes through [17]. ASE‚Äôs debt to equity ratio is much higher than the industry average and that of their competitor TSMC [14][15][16]. Both TSMC and ASE serve high-profile customer Apple. However, TSMC holds bigger contracts as they have a larger footprint in Apple‚Äôs supply chain [23]. There has been a 65.78% growth in shorts within a single month as reported in Jan 29 this year [18]. Not a lot of big money signals. Low institutional ownership of stock [6]. 4 yr growth in total liabilities grew 114% vs. 4 yr growth in total assets that grew 60.4% [12]. Bullish Arguments ASE Technology has tailored its applications to increase their stake in growth markets such as smart cities, smart homes, smart cars/bikes, and smart factories (Industry 4.0) [24]. In late 2020, they established the first 5G mmWave smart factory [25]. Their plan for the future, as announced in the annual shareholders meeting late 2020, points towards an expansion into providing tailored solutions in markets such as medicine and transport, where AI, IoT, and AIoT will play a more significant role [21]. Their sustainability practices and principles have resulted in several awards, such as the double A listing for Global Climate and Water Stewardship [22]. ASE has experienced significant growth in revenue and net income. They‚Äôre now up by 43% compared to 3 years ago [12]. Very low PE and P/B (price to book value) ratio in comparison to industry leader TSMC [2][3][10][11]. ASE also beats TSMC on short % of shares outstanding, 3 month price returns, and earnings growth - in significant ways [4][5][8][9][12][13]. ASE provides semiconductor assembly and testing services for over 90 percent of electronics companies in the world [26]. In 2020, the Taiwanese economy has outpaced China for the first time in 30 years [19]. Analyst average recommendation rating is 1.5 (between Buy and Strong Buy) [20]. Summary ASE Technology has a significant stake in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and although they face serious competition, they‚Äôve adapted quite well and are moving towards a leadership role in industry innovation. It‚Äôs a growth company, in a growth market, in a growth country. Do they need insanely huge contracts from the likes of Apple? No, and their current growth confirms it as they provide their services to over 90% of electronics companies in the world. In fact, some argue that it‚Äôs dangerous to be heavily dependent on a single customer. That being said, their debt to equity ratio is high. Much higher than the industry average. Is this by definition a bad thing? Not necessarily. It might have even scared off some institutional investors, which is fine by me because it means less volatility. But perhaps it's less of a good sign for those who need big money signals. ASE decided to take on quite some debt. It‚Äôs risky for sure but not at a point where there‚Äôs red flags. It's not unusual in the manufacturing/assembly industry but it definitely is an aggressive approach. It could be a calculated risk where the current projected revenue for this year will more than cover their debt if reached [20]. They will need to make optimal use of their cash flow, which has been steadily growing. Will they reach the projections? I‚Äôm of the opinion that they will based on their current growth patterns as well as the tech industry‚Äôs move towards more integrated solutions, which ASE is betting on. When the car industry experienced a massive chip shortage and companies like ASE were running at full capacity, it became clear to me that this shortage would function as a catalyst that will further prepare and propel Taiwanese semiconductor production to handle higher demand in the future. European leaders like Merkel and Macron are pushing for Europe to develop its own chip industry. But how likely is it that major consumers of chips will go through the trial and errors in Europe, at a high cost, rather than to deal with their trusted suppliers who are innovating as we speak? Perhaps I‚Äôm underestimating (or overestimating) matters but when I weigh the bullish and bearish arguments against each other, I can see no valid reason why ASE‚Äôs stock is currently so undervalued. I personally like the company's ethics, milestones, growth, and plans for the future.

Both provide testing (QC) and where ASE focuses more on an assembly and application design, AMKR has their focus more on packaging and logistics. I felt that with TSMC being a Taiwanese company and the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors and design, they're more 'linked' to ASE as they are both very close to each other in the supply chain of their shared customers. But ultimately both TSMC and AMKR are good benchmarks. Assembly is also where it's at imo. I see no reason why ASE can't reach TSMC's market cap in the foreseeable future, especially when you consider their current growth.",1,nan,nan,nan

ASE has experienced significant growth in revenue and net income. They‚Äôre now up by 43% compared to 3 years ago [12]. Very low PE and P/B (price to book value) ratio in comparison to industry leader TSMC [2][3][10][11]. ASE also beats TSMC on short % of shares outstanding, 3 month price returns, and earnings growth - in significant ways [4][5][8][9][12][13]. ASE provides semiconductor assembly and testing services for over 90 percent of electronics companies in the world [26]. In 2020, the Taiwanese economy has outpaced China for the first time in 30 years [19]. Analyst average recommendation rating is 1.5 (between Buy and Strong Buy) [20]. Summary ASE Technology has a significant stake in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and although they face serious competition, they‚Äôve adapted quite well and are moving towards a leadership role in industry innovation. It‚Äôs a growth company, in a growth market, in a growth country. Do they need insanely huge contracts from the likes of Apple? No, and their current growth confirms it as they provide their services to over 90% of electronics companies in the world. In fact, some argue that it‚Äôs dangerous to be heavily dependent on a single customer. That being said, their debt to equity ratio is high. Much higher than the industry average. Is this by definition a bad thing? Not necessarily. It might have even scared off some institutional investors, which is fine by me because it means less volatility. But perhaps it's less of a good sign for those who need big money signals. ASE decided to take on quite some debt. It‚Äôs risky for sure but not at a point where there‚Äôs red flags. It's not unusual in the manufacturing/assembly industry but it definitely is an aggressive approach. It could be a calculated risk where the current projected revenue for this year will more than cover their debt if reached [20]. They will need to make optimal use of their cash flow, which has been steadily growing. Will they reach the projections? I‚Äôm of the opinion that they will based on their current growth patterns as well as the tech industry‚Äôs move towards more integrated solutions, which ASE is betting on. When the car industry experienced a massive chip shortage and companies like ASE were running at full capacity, it became clear to me that this shortage would function as a catalyst that will further prepare and propel Taiwanese semiconductor production to handle higher demand in the future. European leaders like Merkel and Macron are pushing for Europe to develop its own chip industry. But how likely is it that major consumers of chips will go through the trial and errors in Europe, at a high cost, rather than to deal with their trusted suppliers who are innovating as we speak? Perhaps I‚Äôm underestimating (or overestimating) matters but when I weigh the bullish and bearish arguments against each other, I can see no valid reason why ASE‚Äôs stock is currently so undervalued. I personally like the company's ethics, milestones, growth, and plans for the future.

,"Intro This is my short and condensed KISS (keep it stupid simple) review of ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd ($ASX). The basics covers some of the fundamentals, with the figures benchmarked against ASE Technology‚Äôs largest indirect competitor - TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited) - as indicated by ‚Äòvs.‚Äô. Keep in mind that ASE is not a manufacturer of semiconductors. They specialize in assembly and testing, which happens in the final stages of production. TSMC specializes in the early stages of semiconductor production as a manufacturer. They are however both key players in the same industry. Why am I using TSMC as a benchmark instead of comparing against industry averages? Because you don‚Äôt benchmark against ‚Äòaverage‚Äô, you benchmark against the top performers in the same industry. The points made inside the bearish and bullish arguments are my interpretations of the company and stock. The summary is my attempt of bringing everything together. I invite you to totally destroy my DD with your best arguments so we can further debug the analysis on this stock. Let‚Äôs go! Basics Company: ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd.

Whether people like it or not, China is on track to becoming the world's largest economy. If they take back Taiwan, they're going to make damn sure that Taiwan's major manufacturers will take advantage of China's infrastructure, which in some ways is already happening. It'll further boost China's economy. I'm not saying I want Taiwan to lose their autonomy. In fact, I don't agree with many of China's politics, although I'm no fan of US politics either considering the last 2 decades. Politicians in Europe and US are vocal about wanting to further develop their own chip industry but the reality of the matter is that the largest buyers of chips cannot survive without Asia unless major incentives such as huge tax breaks and grants are provided to them, which is highly unlikely.

Low institutional ownership of stock [6]. 4 yr growth in total liabilities grew 114% vs. 4 yr growth in total assets that grew 60.4% [12]. Bullish Arguments ASE Technology has tailored its applications to increase their stake in growth markets such as smart cities, smart homes, smart cars/bikes, and smart factories (Industry 4.0) [24]. In late 2020, they established the first 5G mmWave smart factory [25].

In 2020, the Taiwanese economy has outpaced China for the first time in 30 years [19]. Analyst average recommendation rating is 1.5 (between Buy and Strong Buy) [20]. Summary ASE Technology has a significant stake in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and although they face serious competition, they‚Äôve adapted quite well and are moving towards a leadership role in industry innovation. It‚Äôs a growth company, in a growth market, in a growth country. Do they need insanely huge contracts from the likes of Apple? No, and their current growth confirms it as they provide their services to over 90% of electronics companies in the world. In fact, some argue that it‚Äôs dangerous to be heavily dependent on a single customer. That being said, their debt to equity ratio is high. Much higher than the industry average. Is this by definition a bad thing? Not necessarily. It might have even scared off some institutional investors, which is fine by me because it means less volatility. But perhaps it's less of a good sign for those who need big money signals. ASE decided to take on quite some debt. It‚Äôs risky for sure but not at a point where there‚Äôs red flags. It's not unusual in the manufacturing/assembly industry but it definitely is an aggressive approach. It could be a calculated risk where the current projected revenue for this year will more than cover their debt if reached [20]. They will need to make optimal use of their cash flow, which has been steadily growing. Will they reach the projections? I‚Äôm of the opinion that they will based on their current growth patterns as well as the tech industry‚Äôs move towards more integrated solutions, which ASE is betting on. When the car industry experienced a massive chip shortage and companies like ASE were running at full capacity, it became clear to me that this shortage would function as a catalyst that will further prepare and propel Taiwanese semiconductor production to handle higher demand in the future. European leaders like Merkel and Macron are pushing for Europe to develop its own chip industry. But how likely is it that major consumers of chips will go through the trial and errors in Europe, at a high cost, rather than to deal with their trusted suppliers who are innovating as we speak?

,"Intro This is my short and condensed KISS (keep it stupid simple) review of ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd ($ASX). The basics covers some of the fundamentals, with the figures benchmarked against ASE Technology‚Äôs largest indirect competitor - TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited) - as indicated by ‚Äòvs.‚Äô. Keep in mind that ASE is not a manufacturer of semiconductors. They specialize in assembly and testing, which happens in the final stages of production. TSMC specializes in the early stages of semiconductor production as a manufacturer. They are however both key players in the same industry. Why am I using TSMC as a benchmark instead of comparing against industry averages? Because you don‚Äôt benchmark against ‚Äòaverage‚Äô, you benchmark against the top performers in the same industry. The points made inside the bearish and bullish arguments are my interpretations of the company and stock. The summary is my attempt of bringing everything together. I invite you to totally destroy my DD with your best arguments so we can further debug the analysis on this stock. Let‚Äôs go! Basics Company: ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. HQ: Kaohsiung, Taiwan [1] Industry: Semiconductor assembly, testing & packaging [1] Company Description: Provider of independent semiconductor assembling and test manufacturing services. [1] Exchange: NYSE Ticker: ASX vs. TSM Price:  $8.31 vs. $136.66 [2][3]  Market Cap: 17.3B vs. 604.9B [2][3]  Avg Trading Volume: 2M vs. 11.7M [2][3]  Short % of Shares Outstanding: 0.14% vs. 0.27% [4][5] Institutional Shares: 0.03% vs. 89.29% [6][7] 3 Month Price Returns: 60.74% vs. 41.46% [8][9] PE Ratio: 26.81 vs. 61.28 [2][3]  P/B Ratio: 2.26 vs. 10.69 [10][11]  3 Year Net Income Growth: 43.06% vs. 5.23% [12][13] Debt to Equity Ratio: 1.26 vs. 0.00 [14][15] Industry Average Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03 [16] Bearish Arguments Europe wants to develop its own chip industry. Taiwan can expect competition if Europe pushes through [17]. ASE‚Äôs debt to equity ratio is much higher than the industry average and that of their competitor TSMC [14][15][16]. Both TSMC and ASE serve high-profile customer Apple. However, TSMC holds bigger contracts as they have a larger footprint in Apple‚Äôs supply chain [23]. There has been a 65.78% growth in shorts within a single month as reported in Jan 29 this year [18]. Not a lot of big money signals. Low institutional ownership of stock [6]. 4 yr growth in total liabilities grew 114% vs. 4 yr growth in total assets that grew 60.4% [12]. Bullish Arguments ASE Technology has tailored its applications to increase their stake in growth markets such as smart cities, smart homes, smart cars/bikes, and smart factories (Industry 4.0) [24]. In late 2020, they established the first 5G mmWave smart factory [25]. Their plan for the future, as announced in the annual shareholders meeting late 2020, points towards an expansion into providing tailored solutions in markets such as medicine and transport, where AI, IoT, and AIoT will play a more significant role [21]. Their sustainability practices and principles have resulted in several awards, such as the double A listing for Global Climate and Water Stewardship [22]. ASE has experienced significant growth in revenue and net income. They‚Äôre now up by 43% compared to 3 years ago [12]. Very low PE and P/B (price to book value) ratio in comparison to industry leader TSMC [2][3][10][11]. ASE also beats TSMC on short % of shares outstanding, 3 month price returns, and earnings growth - in significant ways [4][5][8][9][12][13]. ASE provides semiconductor assembly and testing services for over 90 percent of electronics companies in the world [26]. In 2020, the Taiwanese economy has outpaced China for the first time in 30 years [19]. Analyst average recommendation rating is 1.5 (between Buy and Strong Buy) [20]. Summary ASE Technology has a significant stake in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and although they face serious competition, they‚Äôve adapted quite well and are moving towards a leadership role in industry innovation. It‚Äôs a growth company, in a growth market, in a growth country. Do they need insanely huge contracts from the likes of Apple? No, and their current growth confirms it as they provide their services to over 90% of electronics companies in the world. In fact, some argue that it‚Äôs dangerous to be heavily dependent on a single customer. That being said, their debt to equity ratio is high. Much higher than the industry average. Is this by definition a bad thing? Not necessarily. It might have even scared off some institutional investors, which is fine by me because it means less volatility. But perhaps it's less of a good sign for those who need big money signals. ASE decided to take on quite some debt. It‚Äôs risky for sure but not at a point where there‚Äôs red flags. It's not unusual in the manufacturing/assembly industry but it definitely is an aggressive approach. It could be a calculated risk where the current projected revenue for this year will more than cover their debt if reached [20]. They will need to make optimal use of their cash flow, which has been steadily growing. Will they reach the projections? I‚Äôm of the opinion that they will based on their current growth patterns as well as the tech industry‚Äôs move towards more integrated solutions, which ASE is betting on. When the car industry experienced a massive chip shortage and companies like ASE were running at full capacity, it became clear to me that this shortage would function as a catalyst that will further prepare and propel Taiwanese semiconductor production to handle higher demand in the future. European leaders like Merkel and Macron are pushing for Europe to develop its own chip industry. But how likely is it that major consumers of chips will go through the trial and errors in Europe, at a high cost, rather than to deal with their trusted suppliers who are innovating as we speak? Perhaps I‚Äôm underestimating (or overestimating) matters but when I weigh the bullish and bearish arguments against each other, I can see no valid reason why ASE‚Äôs stock is currently so undervalued. I personally like the company's ethics, milestones, growth, and plans for the future.

I know I'm a bit late to the party but I was looking into ASE recently and came across your post.It looks like ASE has some really good ratios, including a price:sales of about 1. The big things that concern me are their quick ratio (less than 1), they arent building any equity like a lot of other major players, and their profit margin is 5.8% (compared to around 25% for other companies in the sector).Any idea why their margin is so much lower than other companies? They project really solid sales growth but at 5% margin the value of the company could seriously lag behind other semiconductor companies.",0,nan,nan,nan

They're heavily invested (and leading) when it comes to highly innovative applications of fabless semiconductors for some really large clients. It takes money to make money when you're ahead of the curve. The quick ratio doesn't say anything about future prospects and is only useful to know if they're currently in some kind of problem, like being over leveraged - which they're not. Same goes for their profit margins. Keep in mind, Amazon wasn't profitable for a very long time and investors saw a huge ROI. It's typical of market leaders. That being said, I do think they need to divest in less profitable markets and operate on more lean principles. It would also be ideal if they find a better balance between debt and equity. Based on what I've seen, I believe they're on path to achieve both objectives. But the riskier the endeavor the more exposed you are to imbalances.
