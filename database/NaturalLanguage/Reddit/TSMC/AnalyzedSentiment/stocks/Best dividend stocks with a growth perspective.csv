,"As the title says - what are your tips on dividend stocks that also have a growth perspective? Currently, I have some money in ETFs and high growth tech. So I would also want a more stable stock that also pays recurring dividends but still has a growth story. Something like TSMC?","If you don't need dividends today but are interested in the long term dividend growth potential then a lot of stocks that are more like ""growth stocks"" with a high Dividend CAGR are probably a better idea. Some of my favorites in this category include:MSFT (10.12% dividend CAGR)V (16.58% dividend CAGR)MA (18.18% dividend CAGR)COST (12.5% dividend CAGR)SBUX (12.14% dividend CAGR)All Dividend CAGR numbers I reference refer to their average annual dividend growth over the last 5 years.Also sidenote, while AAPL stock is loved by many, it's 5 year average dividend CAGR is only 7.94%, which isn't good enough to qualify as a high dividend growth stock in my book (though I still hold a modest position in it), especially since their more recent dividend raises have been getting smaller and smaller.",0,nan,nan,nan

High ROIC and hurdle rate for earnings retention, combined with opportunistic buybacks, have allowed them to compound their per-share dividend quite nicely over the past 20 years.",1,nan,nan,nan

,"As the title says - what are your tips on dividend stocks that also have a growth perspective? Currently, I have some money in ETFs and high growth tech. So I would also want a more stable stock that also pays recurring dividends but still has a growth story. Something like TSMC?","You shouldn't be too hard on yourself. It didn't stay long at those levels, only a brief spell in June and another in October.I added a few times in the high 140s to low 150s, but I was buying from 170 on down. Since then, they've also repurchased about 2% of shares outstanding (at attractive prices), so 175 today is virtually the same market cap as 170 was in May.I agree with you. They are extremely shareholder-friendly and very well-positioned for an economic rebound, whenever that comes. The only drawbacks are that they return most of their earnings to shareholders (if only they could compound at 40% like their retained earnings...) and they're a large-cap, so they're well-covered by Wall Street. So you most likely won't go from rags to riches with TXN, but (in my view) there are some behavioural and analytical biases that allow it to become mispriced from time to time.",3,nan,nan,nan

,"As the title says - what are your tips on dividend stocks that also have a growth perspective? Currently, I have some money in ETFs and high growth tech. So I would also want a more stable stock that also pays recurring dividends but still has a growth story. Something like TSMC?","Yes it would take 6 years to double if they maintain a 12.5% CAGR. It's slow at first, but it compounds more overtime if it maintains a CAGR (hence the importance of buying into stocks with a strong moat/brand).But like u/PanPirat said it's hard to calculate COST's true dividend yield because of their special dividend every couple of years, it's often meaningful enough to push your yield on cost up a fair amount, even if you average it out over the 3 or so year gap since the last special dividend.Their last special dividend was $10 a share in 2020, and before that it was $7 a share in 2017. COST's quarterly dividend by contrast is $0.90 a share, or $3.60 annually.",2,nan,nan,nan

So I would also want a more stable stock that also pays recurring dividends but still has a growth story. Something like TSMC?","You may also need to look historically at how many years these high dividend growth rate companies can keep up that sort of growth rate. You can't stay high growth forever.10 years? 20 years? 30 years? That might give some additional idea of what to expect and whether it's worth it to gamble on the company with the low dividend to keep growing it, or to take a company with a higher dividend already and slower dividend growth (all this assumes you are focused on the dividend primarily, of course.) eg 1% dividend with a 12% growth rate which eventually slows down, or a 5% dividend with a 3% growth rate?",3,nan,nan,nan

Something like TSMC?","PEP is the ultimate dividend growth stock; most years they give a 5 - 10% raise - they just bumped it 10% this year. Other consumer staples like PG and CAG have a good growth history of both earnings and dividends as well. As a bonus, consumer staples typically have the pricing power to prosper in an inflationary environment.In medical, CVS is increasing both its earnings and dividend - they just give a 10% divy increase. PFE is another good divy payer with a long term growth story.In financials, JPM gives both growth and a solid dividendFor tech, semis like QCOM, SWKS, and TSM pay a good dividend and have good long term prospects.",1,nan,nan,nan

So I would also want a more stable stock that also pays recurring dividends but still has a growth story. Something like TSMC?","While CAGR is interesting to measure growth, the price of entry is very high. Hence yield on MSFT is a paltry 1%, while visa is 0.8%. All this assumes that the stock keeps on rising and continues to raise the dividend, less likely with layoffs and a downtrend trend in cycle. You can get 5% with JP Morgan CD, and that’s yield.",1,nan,nan,nan

Something like TSMC?","AVGO in the long term, though it's had a really good run recently and may be pretty well valued at this point. QCOM might be a good alternative in the semiconductor sector - your suggestion of TSM* (the ticker is not TSMC) isn't bad either though I have geopolitical concerns about it.MSFT is one of the more obvious ones.I really like NVO - it's an ADR and pays out twice annually, with it's Q4 dividend payment being substantially larger than its Q2 dividends but this is common with European stocks. NVO owns and produces two drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, that are set to become among the best selling pharmaceuticals of all time over the coming decade as far as I'm concerned. Take that for what you will and definitely do your due diligence because NVO has a high p/e of 40.SQM; BHP and RIO are growth as far as I'm concerned and offer great dividends.Look at REITs - some are definitely growth. I own PLD and PSA, but there are much higher dividend paying ones that are still strong (STAG; O; MPW; AGNC; etc).",0,nan,nan,nan

Something like TSMC?","I'm rather partial to PARA and UMC in this respect.PARA is seeing good revenue growth from streaming and has a strong dividend, but cashflows will be under pressure in 2023 (don't think they cut dividends, but it's a risk). Their subscriber growth story has been consistently underestimated by the market given the relative dearth of prestige TV on their services, but anyone with kids or older relatives who enjoys procedurals should check what they own as it's a very impressive array. That and their willingness to offer products through every conceivable sales window and channel makes me think the business continues to succeed (maybe not the stock price for awhile still though).UMC is a fab company based in Taiwan with foundries in multiple countries around SE Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and is very cheaply valued due to geopolitical risk and some forecasted contraction in 2023. Their dividend was strong last year and should be VERY strong this one if they continue to return the same share of profits, but the additional growth will be 2H 2023 or 2024 at this point which is when Fab 12A P6 and 12i respectively start producing. There will be some revenue decline in the meantime (albeit off a very strong 2022) as weak mobile and consumer electronics demand reduce fab utilization.",0,nan,nan,nan

To me, it's like a hidden gem. Excellent history of driving FCF/share growth and mgmt is focused on it as evidenced by it littered throughout its decks. ""compounding FCF per share"" ""FCF per share growth"", etc. That said, SLGN has a low payout and thus inherently tons of upside to grow its dividend. The Co. has grown its dividend extraordinarily well over the last few years and that will continue, I expect. Incredibly stable business with consistent growth.Another one is Open Text ($OTEX)",0,nan,nan,nan
