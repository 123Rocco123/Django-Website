Some opinions?","AMD and Nvidia already did all the increase and then some… now they are ocervalued. Intel makes around 10 times the money AMD and Nvidia are making and are valued less. They have like 70b cash. 10x employees of Nvidia and AMD.Now the graphics departement is interesting, cause even if Intel can’t make as good top class cards they have their own production capacity, that when they face delivery problems they already sold 10x what Nvidia or AMD could hope for in a product lifecycle.Intel has for long been valued as a value company more than growth, but for them to get into graphics and also compete with TSMC by contract manufacturing might make them eligible for higher P/E valuations. That might make the stock skyrocket again, for the first time in 20 years. But it will grow as their income will grow, no matter what as they are getting into even more ever growing markets.As demand rises with ever growing middle classes in India, Africa, China etc the computer market will keep growing. And Nvidia and AMD might have to manufacture their chips at intel to keep competitive.Samsung proved to Nvidia they can’t handle even smaller quantities of next gen chips, how can people expect Samsung to miraculously be able to handle large scale CPU and GPU production. They can make ARM chips, and they should stick to that as ARM Laptops is becoming a thing thanks to Apple.I’ve sold 30% of my AMD@138 and Nvidia@310 and doubled down on Intel and Microsoft.AMD and Nvidia is now 10% each of my portfolio instead of 15% and Microsoft and Intel around 9-10% instead of 4-5% of my portfolio.TSMC, Samsung and Sony stays at around 5% of my portfolio.I also introduced Volvocars as 3% of my portfolio and Tesla was reduced from 2% to 1%.Spotify constitutes around 3% and the rest is cash ready to buy dip.But if I had to spend more cash on stocks Intel and Volvo are my only buys that I wouldn’t worry about long or short term, perhaps Sony if you want to diversify into multiple stocks.TSMC and Samsung I would consider are dependent on more cyclical market forces.",0,nan,nan,nan

So I have no heart to sell them, they are a part of me.If they do dip, which I think they will, and Ideally they would drop to Nvidia around 75 dollars (300 presplit) this was a newly 200 dollar stock pre corona and AMD to around 25-30. Then I would consider going 25% portfolio on each againAfter any major correction I would consider double down on both of them anyway.But Intel, I feel safe to buy more, I’m just hoping institutional investors will try to lower the price more before they swap even more growth to value stocks as the future markets becomes more and more uncertain 😂",2,nan,nan,nan

Some opinions?","Nvidia is silly overpriced. $764bn market cap on an extrapolated ~$26bn revenue, ~$9bn income. Absolutely insane.AMD in comparison is cheap as fuck. $170bn market cap on extrapolated ~$17.5bn revenue, ~$4bn income. Growth broadly comparable with Nvidia over the past year. If the chip shortage eases up, both AMD and Nvidia's margins on their GPUs will drop over time, but AMD will also end up selling a lot more CPUs, which are much higher margin than their GPUs.I think you're right that on paper Intel looks like a better move at the moment. Seriously low P/E ratio. Alder Lake looks really good, good enough that I doubt AMD's new chips will be much more than competitive. Should have a big dedicated GPU out within the next year that from the leaks sounds seriously efficient - even if the drivers are junk for gaming, miners will love them. GPU designed by Raja Koduri - despite spouting a LOT of BS around the launch of Vega, RDNA was his baby and RDNA was a massive leap forward for AMD, massive jump forward in power and efficiency, and a really lean chip too so cheap to produce. If he can bring some of that magic to Intel that's got me excited.The only thing that has me apprehensive about Intel is that for as long as I have known them they have underdelivered and fumbled landings. Since Lisa Su took over AMD, AMD have executed on every roadmap impeccably, at least met but usually overdelivered on promised performance, and have always met or beat their guidance. AMD just gives me peace of mind.",1,nan,nan,nan

Some opinions?","Yeah, however just as it passed 150 dollars I just had to sell 20% of my AMD, hopefully it will be back around 110 levels within a week or two, so I can buy almost 50% more stocks for the same price 😂The bad thing with Nvidia and AMD is that the amount of stocks has increased over time and I don’t think it will stop as it’s no interest cost on emission money 😂Intel however have bought back stocks making every stock a larger chuck of the company, and they probably will continue doing this.When I bought AMD at 1.86 dollars, I put like 70% of all money I had saved around 19 years old, and I saved money from when I was 12 or something like that. Started Uni and bought the cheapest bike and laptop and AMD stock 😂 I couldn’t even dream about 30 dollars per share back then 😂 but for me even after selling roughly a total of 40% of all my AMD last couple of days, I’m still heavily invested with around 8% of my total value in AMD but everytime it runs past 10% I need to manage my risks.Statistically it’s good to not have more than 8-10% of your net worth in one single venture. And I have like 40% of my value in semiconductors.But long term, I think Nvidia, AMD, Intel all will be winner horses. I don’t need the money I got in the market for the coming 10-20 years so I don’t mind some bumps on the ride. Just always make sure to have 30%+ liquid capital to make counter moves when market works against you, if you are stuck in a bear market and can’t sell your capital hedge it will bear certificates, that way you go +/- zero until you get indications for changing markets. The misstake I think people make in tech growth is going in without a plan B or even an exit plan.It might work when you are investing 10-50k but when you start working with 250k+ a -10% movement is worth a years salary for most people.The more money you have the more important management and diversification becomes.

Can switch up shops easily if one falls behind. People probably forgot how AMD were so screwed with their fabs and were able to finally offload them. I doubt any company will want to touch a fab unless it's out of desperation given the high expense to run that totally kills any margins,0,nan,nan,nan
