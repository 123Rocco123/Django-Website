,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl) Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips: Microsoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips — and they’re all about AI - The Verge Meta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters Google: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com) ChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com) Since I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).",Could've used chat gpt to make this a helluva lot shorter,0,nan,nan,nan

HilariousYou actually suggest that the best GPU’s in the world, which have been developed over the past 30 years, as the primary focus of the third most valuable company in the world, can be replicated within a couple years by companies that have no experience designing chips. If it’s that simple, why is AMD still so far behind Nvida after 20+ years?Even IF, and it’s a big big if, the companies you mention can come close to replicating Nvidia’s GPU’s, they won’t be selling it to their competitors. For the other 10 thousand small and large businesses that want to build and develop AI, Nvidia is the best option, and likely will be forever. That’s why it’s under export controls.The correct analogy here is that this is race for survival, between every company and government in the world. The companies that implement AI the fastest and most effectively are very likely to be market leaders, while those that are slow are almost certain to fail. For this race, you can either drive a Ferrari (Nvidia), Subaru (AMD), or take your chances trying to build your own car from scratch.",0,nan,nan,nan

They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

Nvidia happens to have one that closest aligns with doing well for AI. TSMC holds the power since they are the only real source. Eventually hopefully intel will get there.Imo: AMD has been trying to do what nvidia does for a long time without catching up. I am sure someone might be able to but I think nvidia will be safe for a while. I am expecting a post earnings minor dip within 2 weeks. Overall a good summary post by OP.You can think of this like how Cisco had a giant climb, then fell off once competitors figured out how to do the same thing. But I think that time window will be longer with nvidia due to complexity, and pre-ordered supplies from tsmcI will also say I think nvidia recognizes this, and that is why they announced they will be working with companies to make more specific chips instead of only the current generalized one they have. Given their pricing we will see if people decide to stick with it, but I would say yes. It’s like how people are waiting for good cheap amd gpu’s so nvidia will make their overpriced ones cheaper. But right now they don’t have real competition",1,nan,nan,nan
,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.

We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl) Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips: Microsoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips — and they’re all about AI - The Verge Meta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters Google: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com) ChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com) Since I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).",Not DD.

,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips.

Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.

Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.

This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).

That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

However, in terms of share value, one has to wait and see how much they can really improve their earnings. ASML is a company that is not needed for chip designers (like Nvidia, AMD etc) but for chip producers (like TSMC). They can only increase their revenue (mostly) by selling more machines to TSMC and other manufacturers. The problem is that chip factories take a long time to build and are very expensive. So I think their value will increase in the medium to long term, but don't expect gigantic increases in stock value like Nvidia or Amd as its takes longer for them to improve their revenue.
