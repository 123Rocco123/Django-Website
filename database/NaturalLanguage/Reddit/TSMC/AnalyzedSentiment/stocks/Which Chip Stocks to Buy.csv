,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been observing the chip sector of the stock market and it’s become difficult to determine which stock would be one of the better investments. I have some pros and cons for some of the big names, but if you guys know of any chip stocks that stand out, leave a comment on the post because I’m curious of what you guys have to say about the whole industry. TSMC - high market cap, very successful company but high geopolitical tensions NVDA - one of the best tech stocks out there but have have been consistently growing for 6 months (could be good or bad) INTC - American company with factories all over the world with a great history, but has fallen behind competitors over the last few years. What do you guys think?","I sell semiconductors for a living. Mostly into automotive. The companies you mention are mostly for consumer electronics. This market is slowing. Automotive is continuing to thrive. I am still having record sales monthly. I see automotive semiconductors an attractive place to be in the future especially with EVs coming more online, they have more chip content then ICE vehicles. Just my opinion. The companies that I own are MCHP, NXPI, MPWR and ADI also ON is starting to look attractive, AVGO has a nice dividend. TSMC does build some of the products above but a lot of them have their own fabs which is a real advantage in bringing new chips to market. I may be bias but this is what I see.",0,nan,nan,nan

What do you guys think?",I like ON. I work at a $6B company. The third largest distributor in the world. ON is our third biggest line overall. ON parts are for the most part smaller ASP than other large suppliers so this tells you we sell a ton of parts. There lead times are generally a little lower than average especially in discrete semi’s. They are not the largest semi supplier so they are more nimble in regards to production. My largest customer is looking to resource a lot of another suppliers parts to ON. Most suppliers are still having shortages but ON is better than most. I am on multiple shortage calls per week (Vishay and Murata are the biggest culprits) but ON has less of these escalations. They pivot faster. I am thinking strongly about increasing my position.,2,nan,nan,nan

If you are fine with that risk then go for it. Its probably not a bad deal.INTC? The company is flunking on every part of its business so much so that its barely profitable yet they’re going to some how build these multi billion dollar factories across the country.

TSM is going to be their first customer for their next-gen lithography. ASML has five plants in Taiwan and is committing significant investments in additional operations in the region. There’s basically no scenario where ASML favors Intel over TSM. It makes no sense for them when TSM is years ahead on leading edge chips.

While Intel is easily the worst out of the 3, I believe they have way more upside from it's current position if they're able to turn things around, which I think is a higher chance than not.That being said, AMD likely has plenty of upside to go too. They've only just announced a partnership with Microsoft for investing in AI. Obviously they'll make a breakthrough sooner or later and have a nice pop. Plus it'll ride along with other AI stocks meanwhile. AMD is probably the safest choice here.Nvidia can go either way. I view it as a 50/50 gamble at this point so I'm not adding more.",0,nan,nan,nan
