They are a much bigger and richer company than TSMC, despite lagging a bit behind in technology, so they've embraced a very crude but perhaps effective approach: outspend, outspend, outspend. Samsung is trying to drown out their rivals by outspending and they may well pull it off by 2030.""Unchallenged"" is exaggerated. TSMC is like an Olympic sprinter that's 2 yards ahead of his rivals. It's a lead, but not insurmountable - a speed burst by a rival, or stumble by TSMC, would change everything.",3,nan,nan,nan
