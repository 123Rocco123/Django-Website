,"Despite how high everyone seems to be on TSM, the big boys are all low on it (Morgan Stanley, etc.). Believe me, I'm the furthest from one of those incredulous rubes who follow what the pundits say. However I also keep an open mind and wonder why the low target prices are synchronous across the board. I feel like owning AMD/NVDA/TSM is like owning your own vertically integrated business, which is why I'm interested. Is the recent run up the issues? The fact that it isn't an American business? Other ideas? What are your thoughts?",They are at full capacity and won’t be able to increase their capacity anytime soon may be the reason why the stocks have been stagnant. Over all I think there’s still a lot of room for TSMC to grow and they will continue to have dominance in the market for at least another 3-5 years down the road.,0,nan,nan,nan

However, long term its a great stock. Wait till they open their USA plant.Also, pays a fair dividend. Its staying in my portfolio. I buy a little more every time it dips.",2,nan,nan,nan

Their revenue and growth are way easier to predict compared to any random cloud business. In a long term investment perspective, this is a perfect company.But Wall Street doesn't want something like this. Creating hype is the best and fastest way to make money in the short term. Especially what Wall street does is basically gambling on other people's money. If you win you get a crazy amount of bonuses, if you lose the worst case you lose your job. Therefore they tend to value stocks with more risk.",0,nan,nan,nan

Give them time to increase supply to meet insanely high demand they might not have immediately predicted. Takes time in fabrication.,0,nan,nan,nan

I’m not saying I’m like some TSM fanboy like with Tesla (no comment on that valuation), but it seems completely at odds with their prospects that they’d be underweight.",3,nan,nan,nan
