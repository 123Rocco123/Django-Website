Not all are big companies, but all are considerably lower than they were 3 months ago. I had mostly cash sitting out the last few weeks expecting the market to be choppy until the fed announced some concrete plan. The faang stocks and s&p have jumped right back to all time highs and I'm kinda scratching my head about these i listed. I understand tsm has china concerns and Intel is stagnant (though the new chips coming next week are actually looking like significant upgrades) but a lot of tickers seem to be straight up ignored right now.

Likes of Intel, AMD and APPL. Is it due to the market sentiment that TSM may not be able to fulfill orders?","TSMC has over 50% of the market share on advanced processes. Namely, 7 nm, and 5 nm. The total addressable market for 7 nm and 5nm chips is stagnating. The demands of high-end smartphones, smartwatches, game consoles, and tablets are not growing fast. Just look at the sale of iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. On the other hand, the profit margin of chips goes down quickly once it becomes a mature process. That also affects the forward earning estimation. The chip shortage in the car market is due to a lack of production in mature processes such as 28 nm chips. Analysts estimate the shortage will end in one year once the production catches up. However, the shortage might not end in 2 years. The stock prices of chip companies are bargains. It's a good time to buy.",0,nan,nan,nan

But TSM is building factories in the United States and so is INTC. Foundries are capital intensive with smaller margins than an Nvidia or AMD that are foundry-less. Once the factories are finished in 2024-2025ish, you can see an argument that the supply of chips will outpace the demand and lower prices which may hurt margins. Whether that will happen is obviously TBD but that could be keeping people away. Just a guess.",0,nan,nan,nan
