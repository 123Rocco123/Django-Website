It's based on Europe so it has little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly. Doesn't matter who's making chips, ASML will be a beneficiary.I like INTC because it's reasonably priced unlike some of the other semiconductor names and I think their foundry expansion plan is the right move and will likely succeed given they now have a respected engineer leading the company and that it's success has become an issue of national security. I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.NVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. They have a great CEO and loads of growth tailwinds. Even if it struggles because of its valuation short-term it's hard to see NVDA being a bad company to own long-term.",0,nan,nan,nan

That being said I'll however counter every argument for the sake of argument:ASML is exposed to huge (geopolitical) risks: more than 50% of their revenue comes from China and Taiwan, monopoly isn't protected in China and their dependence on innovation and their suppliers is huge. Also expensive.INTC might seems reasonable priced but that that's only the case if they're able to successfully launch their foundry business, can maintain margins roughly at current levels, they successfully IPO Mobileye and in the longer term achieve process performance leadership. If any of these crucial parts fail the pressure on their margins will make the stock significantly less cheap.Long term growth isn't evident (but likely). Their high price is mainly driven by management execution and the expectation they will capture a large chunk of AI and server market. If they experience production problems maintaining current expectations of growth will prove unrealistic. In the longer term they might find it difficult to bring superior products to the market because competition will be fierce due to high margins in their markets.",1,nan,nan,nan

Everyone owning these stocks should keep these into account though ASML does it’s big business in Taiwan, not really China, right? TSMC buys their machines and the US blocked sales of their machines to China. Still, there may be risk there. Additionally, the stock is expensive. Amazing company but I’m hoping for a pullback.INTC is interesting but they’re losing on the design side and far behind on the foundry side. They need to pull through in a big way that seems too much like a bet to me. US gvt should probably help them out if we want to lead again in chips.Nvidia is obviously amazing but I too have difficulty with such an expensive stock.

Also indirect effects are significant: if China targets ASML, which isn't unthinkable because they don't sell their top products to China, they can target products made using ASML technologies or stimulate ASML customers to switch to Chinese suppliers at a discounted rate. The main fear arises from ASMLs strong tech position and their 'support' of Taiwan, two reasons China might feel obliged to target them.Intel in fact isn't loosing on design. They were solely losing on lithography because they chose a strategy to avoid EUV and they've seem to overcome those problems at this point.

I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.I think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it.",0,nan,nan,nan

It is meaningless if Intel ""catches up"" in terms of node performance if their yield is so low they can't produce in volume. TSMC's lead in this area is massive. If you just go by EUV machines owned TSMC dwarfs Intel, who has next to no EUV.Intel has to produce 4 node leaps in 4 years to pass TSMC on process superiority, which alone would be an unprecedented achievement. Add on to that the difficulty of actually building out the fabs, buying and implementing EUV and producing these new nodes in volume and you're looking at almost impossible task.

We've had quantum computers for years, but scaling the processes up and utilizing it's power are still on the cutting edge of of science. It'll take at least multiple decades before it becomes relevant to the semi sector. I don't know the details about their tech and I don't think they published enough info to assess it's potential.",5,nan,nan,nan

There is also a big issue, everyone will sell raw material to who pay more or have more volume.I will be reading other’s comments, very interested and I’m one who suffers from this shortage in Aerospace, that it’s strictly regulated and select a new supplier is very costly and complicated.",0,nan,nan,nan
