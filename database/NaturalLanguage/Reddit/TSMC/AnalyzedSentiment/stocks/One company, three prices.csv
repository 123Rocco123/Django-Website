,"Interesting read anyone any insights as to why the difference? ‘Researcher and Acadian Asset Management portfolio manager Dr Owen Lamont notes that TSMC shares, which have doubled over the last year, cost 20 per cent more in the US than in Taiwan. One company, notes Lamont, but two different prices.’ https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/11/12/one-company-three-prices-tsmc-mispricing-echoes-the-2000s-dotcom-bubble/","The US listed shares trade as TSM and it's an ADR, short for American Depository receipts.TSMC is the Taiwan ticker (and company acronym). 1 TSM = 5 TSMC, and while generally and in theory it tracks 1:1 there's an arbitrage due to being on two different exchanges, currency fluctuations, and the Taiwan exchange has very limited hours and shares are traded in blocks of 1k.There is a massive market of speculators that try to profit off of these small differences.Taken together some price differences do emerge between them, and you'll notice TSMC has a lot less historical volatility than TSM, but they ultimately revert back to roughly 1:1 before long.TSM is traded and pays its dividend in USD, while TSMC is traded and dividended in NTD. While you'd want to double check for yourself, generally you'll still be paying taxes in Taiwan if you own this ADR because TSMC withholds it in Taiwan unless you're in an account that allows you to circumvent Taiwan's flat investment gains tax of 21%.",0,nan,nan,nan
