,"Per Reuters “The Biden administration is developing plans to quickly spend $52 billion to deal with semiconductor supply issues if Congress passes a bill funding such efforts, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Thursday.” I would think that this only bodes well for Companies like tsmc and AMD, increasing their potential outlook. What do we think?","Should be beneficial to quite a bit. Rare earth metals, chip makers, the EV industry and most of tech should see a boost if it gets passed.",0,nan,nan,nan

A handful of multi-billion dollar mega-corporations get handouts from the government which closes the door on any competitive advantage a smaller, more nimble company would have to fill the gap. Necessity is the mother of innovation. Now that the necessity is gone, what innovations will no longer be developed?",2,nan,nan,nan

What do we think?","What? Of course they can legislate to at least improve shortages. Solve is a strong word, but I’m willing to bet 5 years from now having a stronger in-house semi/chip industry will be a massive gain for both the economy and from a security perspective.",1,nan,nan,nan

What do we think?","Semiconductor R&D costs billions not millions to develop. Most countries are back rolling that cost like Taiwan, Korea and Netherlands. TSM/Samsung/ASML.Fact is USA dropped the ball on leading the world in R&D with DARPA and NASA and now other countries are outspending to catch up or even surpass in industries like defense, semiconductors and AI.Meanwhile you have US CEOs at Intel and Boeing that rested on their laurels and pumped their stock to get Wall Street approval and a payday and ignored their engineers. (Read up some Bloomberg articles on Boeing’s Ceo Dennis Muilenburg or Intels Brian Krzanich - after heralded as geniuses by Wall Street it turned out they cut corners on the product to pat shareholders and themselves on the back)If you are behind and Intel has repeatedly shown that, it’s not a bad idea to double down on R&D to catch up.",1,nan,nan,nan

What do we think?","No amount of money they throw at it matters. It takes at least 3 to 4 years to build a chip foundry from start to finish, no matter how much is spent, and it takes billions at the minimum. There’s only like 5 to 6 in the entire world right now (which is part of why a shortage even exists at all) and they’ve already planned on building one here before the current whitehouse admin.

What do we think?","This^, people may not agree with Biden. I don't even benefit off of him being our president. Not through my taxes or the policies he pushes. But I do want America and the well being of my neighbors to rise along with the lower/middle class. Joe Biden's infrastructure plan is a replica of China's except tailored to U.S markets. Whether we like China or not doesn't matter, it works. I actually really dislike Biden and Trump does favor me more and my personal endeavors. But I do think that the U.S is lacking in infrastructure in order to properly compete. Is it inefficient? Probably, but I don't really know of a better way to build infrastructure besides this that transitions well into future wealth building. We might have to play second fiddle moving forward. And that's better than the alternative which is self destruction.",2,nan,nan,nan

Intel has 15 by itself: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000015142/programs.htmlPlease shut the fuck up if you don’t know what you’re talking about or if you’re too lazy to fact check yourself.,1,nan,nan,nan

What do we think?","My memory served me somewhat incorrectly. It’s 5 to 6 companies, not the number of foundries, that produce about 50% of all wafer production, all the others is a dismal amount of production in comparison, thus the large supply/demand difference, which is what I had originally read. I had read this almost 3 months ago, once, so I’m cutting myself some slack. Funny though that despite me being wrong there, the same issue remains and throwing money still doesn’t work since certain complicated equipment needed to make the wafers is in very short supply. Not to mention the foundry themselves do still take years to build is still a factor. I still standby my original point.Also fuck you too.",2,nan,nan,nan
