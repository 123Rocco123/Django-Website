,"TSMC has been trading sideways for around a year now, likely due to the international chip shortage. Are we expecting that to subside next year and for TSMC to start trending up in price? What kind of price do you think we could realistically expect for them a year from now? Seems like some competition could be gaining ground, but chips and transistors aren't going anywhere and if anything, demand is growing insanely fast.",TSM goes down to 108 quite a bit. Check it's history for 2021 and dipping to 108.,0,nan,nan,nan

Consistently around 20% growth. Stocks hasn't moved as market is ignoring it due China Taiwan tension, and tbf it seems reasonably valued at the moment. I think it is going to be the winner next 1-2 years.",0,nan,nan,nan

The demand for semiconductors will never go down even with high inflation. Also the high demand for Nvidia and AMD products will continue well into next year, which means high demand for the semiconductors that go in them (and also good luck finding a GPU if you need one, unfortunately).",0,nan,nan,nan

They certainly aren't going anywhere but I think that is a big reason their stock has been relatively flat compared to other tech companies. It's a big reason I recommend SOXQ over the popular SMH.",0,nan,nan,nan

My apologies, your liege.Took your advice and searched reddit for it, pretty clear that this is just the next big thing for WSB and you latched on. Explains why you got defensive when someone asked you to clarify a nonsensical statement, because you got roped in by a bunch of gamblers and now you're backfilling why you got into the stock with other peoples' analysis.Those fond of fundamental analysis and confident in their holdings welcome opposing views. They want to understand what they own and don't blindly follow what others say and aggressively shoot down any opposing ideas. Often times poorly run companies are valued cheaply for a reason; once retail moves onto the next thing, good luck.",3,nan,nan,nan
