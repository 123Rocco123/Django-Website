,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays. Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting). Why ARK? Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an internal annual hurdle rate of 15% based on a 5-year time horizon But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes too tolerant of overly stretched valuations As a result, I’m hoping to give you the best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices, all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies  To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so think of this post as a potential starting point for more research My Process & Selection Criteria First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries. My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark. Next, my selection criteria, which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings): Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high - provides context around market sentiment Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth - guide for the future Greater than 60% LTM gross margins - operational efficiency LTM cash flow positive - operational efficiency LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x - valuation Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon The Top 5 Picks of the Week 2U - a leading edtech company 52 week high discount: 41% LTM revenue growth: 34% LTM gross margins: 71% LTM cash flow positive: 0% EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate 52 week high discount: 26% LTM revenue growth: 46% LTM gross margins: 48% LTM cash flow positive: 33% EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies PagerDuty - an incident response software company 52 week high discount: 36% LTM revenue growth: 27% LTM gross margins: 87% LTM cash flow positive: (35%) EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data. Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more 52 week high discount: 23% LTM revenue growth: 34% LTM gross margins: 57% LTM cash flow positive: 29% EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips 52 week high discount: 15% LTM revenue growth: 33% LTM gross margins: 53% LTM cash flow positive: 29% EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products Edit: One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",Let’s give this guy some flair for doing this and sharing with us!,0,nan,nan,nan
