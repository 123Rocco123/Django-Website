,"**I have a position in INTC** Intel Corporation is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). As a result, Intel designs and manufactures its own chips. In recent years, Intel has struggled with innovation. Competitors such as TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia have chipped away at Intel’s market share. The previous CEO, Bob Swan, failed to foster a culture of innovation vital to operating in the semiconductor industry. After being replaced in 2021, Bob Swan’s successor, Pat Gelsinger, immediately shifted the company’s focus towards IDM 2.0, focusing on technology and manufacturing capacity. This initiative comes at significant capital costs partially offset by Western nations’ subsidies in the aftermath of global COVID-19 supply chain disruptions. While risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel’s current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC’s announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel’s at the estimated time of release. As a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value. The market and intrinsic value gap exists due to poor short-term business performance and execution risk.","It has already ""come back"" 50%. You're pretty late to let us know",0,nan,nan,nan

Or only looking at current/recent financial results.Intel has been righting their ship ever since their new management took over in 2021. It's a new company. They're investing a lot of money in all the right places. Their roadmaps are impressive, and so far they've actually been on track.A major client pre-paid for 18A capacity? A leading node ahead of TSMC, in the US? Nvidia praising their upcoming nodes? Meteor Lake on track, making it the third year they're hitting annual architecture targets? A fairly successful entrance into the GPU market? This exceeds all of my expectations.I thought I'd never invest in Intel, but they are successfully pulling a 180, while the stock price has gotten such a beating even since their most hopeless years. Their future now is brighter than its been in way over a decade. And their market cap is smaller than AMD's, an also great company, but with a fraction of Intel's business, smaller market share in nearly all of the markets Intel is also in.. and no fabs.",0,nan,nan,nan

Though that's not really because of SPR's dominance over Genoa, they are almost certainly just selling SPR at shit margins to get sales going.They have few to no products that dominate in any of their markets right now,Realistically, neither is AMD. Everywhere other than server, AMD and Intel are pretty close. And in GPUs, Nvidia is just beating AMD and Intel outright, though to be fair AMD is a lot closer to Nvidia than Intel is.and their road map on architectureIntel hasn't disclosed a roadmap on architecture. They used too, but AFAIK they haven't recently. We could talk about rumors tho, if you would likeand process is disappointing.Their roadmap for process is like the opposite of disappointing lolTo really come back Intel needs a win on all fronts and it doesn't looks promising right now.Really? That's the definition of success for Intel? Winning on literally all fronts they compete in? That seems like an insanely high bar....It's going to be a rough road for Intel to get back to the top and it's going to hurt their bottom line more to get there.I agree with that.",1,nan,nan,nan

If you sell January 2025 35 put and 45 call that should net you around $1,000. I haven't looked at the prices in a few weeks but somewhere in that neighborhood. Spend $3,800 on the shares. $700 of potential share game plus the $1,000 on the options. That's a $1,700 return on a 3800 investment so just under 50% by January 2025.The part I like the most is you're not really betting on some growth model You're just betting on them slowly improving. I did the same trade at 33, 100 shares, sold a 35 put and a 40 call that did calculate out to just over 50%I figure if we go into a recession and if people actually start unloading stocks during that scenario which is far from certain, I wouldn't mind picking up another hundred shares at 35 - the premium I got on the put. If it goes higher or just go stagnant the options burn up and you don't need a large gain in share price to fulfill the investment target",0,nan,nan,nan

Do you think that after the Ukraine war and Covid companies are not worried about supply chains? TSMC is DELAYING its US fabs and putting current gen processes in them. Intel is building new fabs in the west and putting NEXT gen processes in them. Intel is going to take market share. The improvement of process nodes is like a tide that raises all ships.

I read your paper, and the entire thing is hardly a findings or analysis paper, you're just going over balance sheets and CPU performance. Which is funny because CPU performance is irrelevant, as things like the IHS, cooling, and size limitations make it strictly for low end use cases like consumer electronics. Not military grade stuff, which is the real conversation here.- Your conclusion has no real substance. You're saying Intel being in the west has a ""unique value proposition"", but what consumer actually cares where the chips are coming from? You fail to look at opposing sides or to actually showcase where someone could further take your findings, which again proves your bias. You're EXTREMELY relying on PROMISES, which is what the roadmap is. Remember when Intel was supposed to get to 14 nm in just a few years? You do remember, you just chose to gloss over it in 1 sentence. What makes the current roadmap any more reliable than their previous one? You also do realize that reducing nm size isnt a linear process right? Just because they can trail behind at the moment, doesn't mean that Intel can magically catch up to all that R&D of competitors.- Speaking of competitors, Samsung is a much better alternative than Taiwan if we're going by your argument of *for some reason* dodging Taiwan. It's very clear you aren't an engineer, which is fine. But please for the love of God realize that the gap between TSMC and Samsung is massive, and Intel is so far in the back you cannot even see it. Can they catch up? Maybe if every star in the universe lines up, but investors obviously don't believe it and you see that in the price.- More on TSMC, they're trying to expand to the west, and currently its going to plan. The number 1 issue TSMC has with expansion is that there are straight up hardly any qualified employees in Europe or America, that's been repeated several times in press releases. Really who else has industry leading experience? Not even Samsung can fulfill those roles. That's something that doesn't even seem to be a factor in your thinking.- You also mention AMD a lot (again why the hell are we talking about consumer CPUS that hardly matters) and their server offerings. You talk about the speed and wattage.... but not the real reason AMD is starting to pack a punch in the server space. Which is the price. Not only do they do everything Intel does but better (there is far more here than speed, theres more expansion in PCIE lanes too), they make it cheaper as well.- There is so much inconclusive evidence and trust placed in Intel when they've shown to consistently disappoint, it's astounding this was even published. Even if everything I said is wrong, this paper is written incorrectly, more like an essay than an analysis. The format is off, and so is the topic of focusing on consumer chip offerings and not the actual fabrication of it. This was made by a person who is getting started with understanding business, and has absolutely no clue on the real hardware side of it. Funny, because that's exactly who Intel was led by and why it failed.",0,nan,nan,nan

The main hurdle is Intel 4, and MTL will almost certainly be announced in 2 days. Intel 3 is adding HD libs to Intel 4, Intel 20A won't increase density much, just make the move over to GAAFET and BSPD. Intel 18A is prob just a refinement and adding denser libs to Intel 20A.

Until the samples and yield is high enough it is premature to judge the future. TSMC can make it for 50% less outside US. For iphone 14 3-nm with 65,000 wafer Apples pays !$1.3 billion dollars to its current supplier. That $1.3B going to Intc does not help that much with bottom line. Without reading what Intel is now targeting, I would hesitate to make any claims. It will take more time to demonstrate it is capable of execute a new plan but alone price. Most of the investment is coming as a grant from Feds. This is before translates to a stock price that I cannot predict at this moment.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"**I have a position in INTC** Intel Corporation is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). As a result, Intel designs and manufactures its own chips. In recent years, Intel has struggled with innovation. Competitors such as TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia have chipped away at Intel’s market share. The previous CEO, Bob Swan, failed to foster a culture of innovation vital to operating in the semiconductor industry. After being replaced in 2021, Bob Swan’s successor, Pat Gelsinger, immediately shifted the company’s focus towards IDM 2.0, focusing on technology and manufacturing capacity. This initiative comes at significant capital costs partially offset by Western nations’ subsidies in the aftermath of global COVID-19 supply chain disruptions. While risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel’s current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC’s announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel’s at the estimated time of release. As a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value.
