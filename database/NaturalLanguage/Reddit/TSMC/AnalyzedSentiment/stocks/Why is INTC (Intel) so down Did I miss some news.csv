It's a broken company that's on the mend, so the reports they give out are a lot of expectations and goals, not accomplishments. These are not what you would call a stable foundation (and intel has a history of falling on it's face, especially venturing into new technologies like AI). Furthermore, the foundry itself has yet to be profitable and has been a lengthy investment with not much return. Regardless, with all this negativity against it, Gelsinger is a man with an actual Tech/Engineering background and will hopefully steer the company out of rough waters into smooth sailing. He has already proven to be more competent than the previous two.",0,nan,nan,nan

Intel does have a an exceptional history of dragging their feet and treading water. Corporate complacency and stagnation. The elusive 7nm node. They say it's harder to defend the championship belt than it is to win it. So in a likeness only in hindsight are we able to see they shot themselves in the foot or fell on their face. You're right, they are in a sense mending but in reality it's more like catch-up, and unfortunately the amount of lost ground to make up for is exponential. The few years they squandered didn't put them a few years behind it put them almost a decade behind. At the moment they are still doing exactly what they said they would a few years ago. Expecting shrinking revenue and focusing their cash flow on playing catch-up in rebuilding. So why is the stock low or stagnating? Because that kind of plan is literally investor-repellant. From the perspective of wall st why invest in something that is telling you to not expect any growth for the foreseeable future. Intel is still a solid company making solid chips and still has remnants of its monopolistic roots in sectors of the market that matter. It will go up, be patient.",1,nan,nan,nan

I’ve got 2k shares for the following reasons:18A- Gelsinger is quoted as saying, “I’ve bet the company on 18A.” 18A will be the first node to utilize backside power and give a 6% increase in processing speeds. That’s in addition to the gains moving from 20A to the more advanced 18A node. These efficiencies are obviously incredibly important when it comes to the advancement of chip technology. Samsung and TSMC won’t have the ability utilize backside power until 2026.EUV lithography Machines- Intel bought all 5 of ASML’s 2024 machines, leaving its competitors with nothing until late 2025 at the earliest. These machines are the key to producing the most advanced chips in the world in the most efficient way possible with Intel planning on utilizing them for their 14A nodes. They will have, at minimum, a year head start on their rivals with how to best use this technology at a mass scale.Chips act/subsidies: currently the largest beneficiary. Us government is heavily subsidizing their commercial fabs as well as one specific for national defense. Germany, Ireland and Israel are all giving massive subsidies to build their fabs.IFS: Intel's initiative to provide manufacturing services to other semiconductor companies. It leverages Intel's advanced manufacturing processes and technologies to produce custom chips for clients. This move marks Intel's expansion beyond designing and producing its own chips to offering its manufacturing capabilities to external customers, competing with other foundries like TSMC and Samsung Foundry. Intel aims to capitalize on its cutting-edge fabrication facilities and expertise to serve a broad range of customers in various industries.TSMC Geopolitics: TSMC's operations in Taiwan make it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Any disruption in the region could impact TSMC's supply chain and operations.Mobileye- is an Israeli technology company specializing in the development of vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving technology. Mobileye's technology includes features like lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems. Intel sold of 1.5 billion worth and still own 88% of the company. The stock is up big this year.Healthcare: Intel has been involved in the healthcare sector for quite some time. Intel's technology is used in various healthcare applications, including medical devices, data analytics, and telehealth solutionsFinancials: Intel's financials remain strong, with a solid balance sheet, consistent revenue growth, and healthy cash flow generation when not spending tens of billions on the most important fabrication plants in the world.

It isn't about to post massive earnings while it pours all of its cash flow into reinvestment in itself. That reinvestment is going to take multiple years as these new Fabs and expansions to current ones go up. Intel dipping its toes into a foundry model is a great idea. The reason why is that it is placing itself in a position to work with almost any company of the likes of nvidia or anyone else who needs chips made. It is also working to match the abilities of TSMC with what nm process'es it can acheive. Also, keep in mind the cost of building these facilities is so high that the barrier to entry is jaw dropping. There are only so many players with the ability to make chips at different specifications and there is only so much capacity to service those customers. Nvidia is a profit margin giant because it is a design firm and it outsources its production to partners. What hapens when a competitor has a better design than nvidia, what do they have to be flexible other than cash. Intel may no longer be the go to designer of the chips but I doubt they are going anywhere for the foreseeable future with how they are creating a vertical supply chain and reinvesting in themselves right now. Not to mention the US Government isn't about to let their US arbitrage against TSMC go anywhere. Look at Isreal, they will continue to pump subsidies to ensure the US is not wholly reliant on a foreign company for chip making. The whole world is run on these chips now. Not all requiring 3nm wafer production with its high margins but Intel has just made itself irreplaceble at the present moment to the US Security. I am pro Intel but i think there is a strong case to buy in right now because of its valuation compared to its peers. If you want to buy a company that is hot and overvalued you can. Intel stock is getting beaten up because most people don't understand that reinvestment can make financials appear as losses. It will probably be a very long road due to the nature of this reinvestment but during that road as people are impatient I am sure this stock will be pushed to undervalued levels.",0,nan,nan,nan

Even people who are obsessed with semiconductors are usually badly confused to a degree that has no counterpart in other industriesIf you ask a random person on the street to guesstimate the top speed of a new car, they will of course make mistakes but they will not say ""Is it 0.002 miles per hour?"", because people have a somewhat reasonably accurate mental model of what cars can do. That is not true at all for semiconductorsOn top of that, the people in the street judging cars will also score better when you ask about their confidence. So even if they are about to make bad guesses, they will tell you ""this really isn't my area of expertise, I don't know anything about cars and I might get it badly wrong"". Again, totally the opposite for semiconductorsHere is an analogy of how I see it, with Intel represented by ToyotaToyota makes cars and competes with Volkswagen and Tesla. Toyota's customers believe that their cars have a top speed of about 0.9 miles per hour, because they have been resting on their laurels, whereas Volkswagen has worked hard and achieved 0.92 miles per hour and Tesla recently reached speeds of up to 1.3 (!!!) miles per hour through massive innovation. Their customers also believe that they are well informed, excellent judges of car quality and that they can deduce the future success of Toyota based on this knowledge. Other considerations (like how much money Toyota currently makes, what their business track record is etc.) are not really relevant because we know what will happen to it in the future because of our car knowledgeI'm not trying to be funny or insult anyone btw, this is genuinely how I see it and I think it's 1 small part of why semiconductor companies have such erratic valuations",0,nan,nan,nan

Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.As for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.In my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai ""High uncertainty, low risk"" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",0,nan,nan,nan

Once had a AMD Radeon GPU, was fine too. On steam, Intel still holds 65% market share for processors, the GPU market share is growing and stands at roughly 8%. Why would it be valued so much lower than AMD or Nvidia? They are delivering world-class chips, favored in many sectors - including server environment. ARM biting into their PC share? Ok, let's see. I also hold Qualcomm shares. But the point is that Intel isn't going anywhere soon with massive public support for their production sites in both the US and Europe out of strategic interest. Chips are the future and there are only so many companies able to deliver on that.Ok, the stock is not ""sexy"" or ""trendy"" but the rest is rock solid.I like investing in companies that are already delivering world-class products high in demand and have a low stock value at the moment. There are companies purely based on promises that have high valuations, Intel is delivering as we speak.But hey, stock prices are all about different perceptions of different people. I am in for Intel.",0,nan,nan,nan

Semiconductor industry can only go up in the future, specially with the rising fields of AI and robotics.  There are several foreseeable political reasons why it will grow. 1. The west and the USA in years to come will do everything in their power to diminish the rise of China. Free market is only free until you stop profiting from it. 2. TSMC is on a island that can get into Russia-Ukraine style of war over night. 3. The republicans in USA are now focusing on strengthening domestic industry over globalism. Yes, Trump is a clown, but his politics on reducing money flowing out and keeping things domestic is becoming a trademark of republican party, and things like this are very important when looking into 30 years in the future. I think company like intel cannot fail. Worst, nvidia will buy them. I actually think intel is deeply undervalued while nvidia being overvalued. Yes data centres and AI are nvidia’s future, but that is the current trend driving the price, once it becomes apparent how much damage spending electricity for ai and data centres does to the environment, nvidia will drop, and companies like intel who invest in neuromorphic computing will bull through the stock market. Not too mention that intel invested millions in supercomputer that are used for simulation of resonant tunneling effect (rtd diodes) because as transistor sizes go down, the quantum effect will become more important. Maybe I am just an intel fan, but I think they will bull as nvidia at some point in the future ",0,nan,nan,nan
