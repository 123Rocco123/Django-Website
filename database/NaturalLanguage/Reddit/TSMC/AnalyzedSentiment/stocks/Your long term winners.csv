And on top of that Jack Dorsey is a tech guru who has no problem running large companies and he's an innovator. I believe he will keep finding ways to expand Square and keep them largely relevant in the FinTech sector-- a sector that many think will become increasingly relevant as we move into the futureI will gladly admit that it's not a sure-fire thing, but I think the hype surrounding it is justified. I'm curious as to why you aren't a fan?",2,nan,nan,nan

I am thinking amazon, Microsoft, nvidia, tsmc and some solid companies in ev, 5g and renewable energy. Any recomendations?","not dumb at all.The slow growth is because it's an ETF so it's a collection of stocks, which generally means it's going to grow slower but it's much more safe/less volatile.The hype around it is that it's a collection of renewable energy ETFs, and the future seems to be shifting largely towards renewable energy sources in attempts to halt global warming. We're seeing a widespread shift away from oil and fossil fuels and instead renewable sources of clean energy like solar panels and windmills are taking over. Even large companies are now making efforts to become carbon neutral by ~2040, such as Amazon and Walmart, and this kind of ETF is going to be a beneficiary of that. That's another reason why the growth has been so slow to this point, because it hasn't been a main focus of many of these companies until now.Another benefit of getting into this stock right now is the chance for it to immediately spike in November if Biden wins.Basically, in a nut shell, there has never been a greater focus on renewable energy. It's definitely not a stock you want to buy if you're looking for some immediate payouts, but if you have no problem investing your money in a safe ETF, and don't mind waiting 10 or 20 years (or perhaps even as little as 5), this is going to be a great option.",2,nan,nan,nan
