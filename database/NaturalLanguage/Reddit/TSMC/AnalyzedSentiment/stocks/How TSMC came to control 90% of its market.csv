,"Taiwanese company TSMC is one of the biggest names in semiconductor chips, and is now expanding around the globe. The success of TSMC is the result of the company’s business model (not competing with the companies that outsource production to it) and well as the hefty budget it has spent on research. Right now, TSMC is producing chips with 3-nanometer tech in Taiwan, and is in the process of expanding beyond Taiwan’s borders to form presences in Japan and the US. Meanwhile, it seems TSMC is likely to be caught more and more in the crossfire between Taiwan and China. The president of Taiwan supports the company’s overseas expansion, but the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) is not amused, and claims that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan is “ruining” the company. What do you think TSMC’s expansion will mean for the company and the economy of Taiwan? What impact do you expect the conflicts between China and Taiwan to have on TSMC in the future?

What do you think TSMC’s expansion will mean for the company and the economy of Taiwan? What impact do you expect the conflicts between China and Taiwan to have on TSMC in the future? ","Lots of replies missing the point. For a lot of tech it makes sense to have higher PEs as they expand markets and gain customer base.TSMC manufactures silicone processors. It’s a lot harder to expect that silicone processor use would double in the next few years as opposed to Amazon expanding in the server space.Edit because some of you don’t understand:Even if tech explodes in the next year, TSMC’s share of newfound wealth will 1. Only come about after demand trickles through from consumers to TSMC client orders and 2. won’t be as large of a pump in value.Consider Adobe. There was a large increase in buzz around content production during the pandemic. Many consumers decided to purchase their production software from adobe. If I am adobe and want to distribute an additional copy of photoshop, the marginal cost of production approaches zero as I sell more copies. I mean after all, it’s pretty easy to copy a file from one computer to another.The same cannot be said for a company that’s base operation is manufacturing a physical good. It’s especially ridiculous to assume the same given the incredible tolerances required in their processes used today. They spend millions of dollars trying to operate at the most efficient scale because manufacturing has been reduced to a competition of scale efficiencies.One reply mentioned that “chips are in everything now” and that’s true. How many items in your everyday life could even use a chip that don’t already have one? This is the exact limitation that silicon manufacturing has in the foreseeable future. These chips have already been put into the marketplace, meaning the capacity to manufacture and replace them already exists. There is a physical and rather logical reason why the TSMC valuation is what it is. They just can’t grow as fast as the other tech companies can, and if they do grow, it is a lagging indicator of growth in consumer markets.",2,nan,nan,nan

Intel wants to, apparently, but they still are a competitor so why would they let them. Also Intel kinda sucks now. After repeatedly promising 7nm for 3 years and constantly failing to actually deliver. It's lost a lot of investor and consumer confidence.TSMC has a large moat. If they fail, it means that everyone is going to be using slower shittier technology. The real question is: is Apple, Nvidea, AMD okay with that?

","The real moat here is TSMCs manufacturing advantage. Staying at the leading edge, requires deep industry knowledge, working closely with ASML to source EUV lithography, and spending major capex. Because TSMC secures upfront purchase orders for leading edge nodes, they can afford to have lower yields initially as they perfect the tech ahead of everyone else. lnterestingly enough, this was also a large part of Intel’s moat from the 1960s-2010s. Bruce Greenwald wrote this up in his Value Investing book. But eventually, intel lost its manufacturing edge to TSMC though.

It reminds me of how North Korea always tries to say anything it’s democratic neighbors do is provoking their bad behavior.I have a super concentrated bet on them because I see them being a trillion dollar company someday and trading at a very reasonable PE. But I am very aware of the risk. My hope is that if China ever does attempt an invasion, it won’t be for at least a decade and TSM will have plenty of time to have contingency plans in place. It’s very interesting that their factories would be inoperable by China post-invasion as well.Another angle to this is that if/when that all happens, all of the tech industry will be hurting. Likely the entire global market would fall into recession. So there are many parties that are very interested in making sure TSMC can succeed no matter what China does.

And China is well aware of the fact that it has many enemies, also that India might use the situation to „solve“ their border dispute. China is quite open about its weaknesses in its papers they give out by the military - but only because they are about to get rid of them. For China to change its course on Taiwan (aka to let it be) though it‘d need a regime change. It doesn‘t seem like the Taiwan question is only Xis own aim, but more for the broader party. Still it doesn’t seem very likely that Xi won’t be in charge in China for this decade. We‘ll have to see how things turn out over there. It was also possible for Taiwan to elect a way more china-friendly party to power and therefore open Chinas path to get control over Taiwan through soft power (surveys suggest that the Taiwanese people aren‘t so fond of China though). Or the US getting a president, who doesn‘t want to protect Taiwan so that things are settled quite fast. But as things stand by now all these alternatives are quite unlikely.

US coming off a contentious election, Covid shenanigans wracking the global economy, and a less than stellar Afghanistan pullout all dovetails into a nice little lightning war for a Ukrainian 2014: 2 This Time it's the Whole Country Boogaloo. But a mix of deadly, self-imposed shortfalls of the Russian armed forces, a US president who isn't the wet noodle he's presented as, and a galvanized, coordinated Western power bloc prevented a quick victory and ensured the hobbling of Russia as a military power for at least a decade. I think Xi sees this and realizes it's his ass on the line next if he tries to pull the same thing and China really can't afford a failure of that magnitude. A move against Taiwan was probably likely (24-30 timeframe) in the past but unless there's some major destabilizing event in the West (again) that sets up similar conditions, then I think African proxy conflicts become the bread and butter of Chinese power projection in the next few decades.",4,nan,nan,nan

Right now, TSMC is producing chips with 3-nanometer tech in Taiwan, and is in the process of expanding beyond Taiwan’s borders to form presences in Japan and the US. Meanwhile, it seems TSMC is likely to be caught more and more in the crossfire between Taiwan and China. The president of Taiwan supports the company’s overseas expansion, but the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) is not amused, and claims that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan is “ruining” the company.
