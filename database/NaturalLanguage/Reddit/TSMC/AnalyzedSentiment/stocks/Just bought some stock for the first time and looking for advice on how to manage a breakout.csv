,"My wife and I just bought some TSMC stock (2330) the day before it jumped 6%, so obviously we're feeling good about it so far. However, it's the first time either of us has invested in the market, so I want to make sure we manage things properly. For example, she wants to be very conservative about things; she thinks we should set a number - like 20% - and sell immediately if the stock jumps that high. That makes practical sense. But then I think, ""but what if it goes higher and we artificially cash out too soon?"" For example, I read about the '8-weeks-hold' rule, which would suggest in this situation to not sell too quickly, maybe?

My specs are usually small or mid cap growth companies I think could become monsters in 10 years. I don’t sell unless I realize I was wrong.It doesn’t sound like you had a goal when you bought the stock, which is fine. You’re new and we all have to learn somehow.If a 6% gain makes you happy, then sell now before you turn a quick gain into a hefty loss. I bought DFS and USB on Thursday as long term holds, but they popped 10%-11% today so I took the win and sold.We’re in an extremely volatile market. A 6% gain today can easily mean a 10% loss tomorrow. Or it could go up another 10%. No one can really predict the direction of the market or an individual stock.

Any advice on how we might proceed?","Is this a long term investment or are you trying to increase your holdings?If it's the former.. don't do anything, just sit on it and keep DCA until you don't want to own anymore shares. Then collect that sweet dividend for years to come and reinvest appropriately.If you are trying to use the intial investment to compound itself you'll need to pay more attention to the swings. A safe rule of thumb on upswings is to sell as many shares as would cover your initial investment then keep the rest in portfolio as ""free shares"". This way you're only reinvesting the same amount but you gain shares over time. Slower, steadier, safer.One technique anyways. There are plenty of guides out there for DCA and long term investing techniques.",0,nan,nan,nan

That’s hardly conservative, so I’d definitely agree with selling if it jumps there. The only way to give advice is to understand your circumstances: what’s your risk level? Do you plan to have big expenses in the near future? How old are you? Etc... there are plenty of resources to consult that will run you through a questionnaire of sorts and give you a rough risk profile you can reference. Ideally, speak with a professional.Good luck!

So if you want to add another stock take 5% away from your etf. Then most people don’t actually sell unless it’s about 10% over your target of 5%. Gotta let your winners run some.There is a difference column which break down what to add to on your next buy, technically negative means sell but I found that just adding to the “positive” will move the others with in tolerance.
