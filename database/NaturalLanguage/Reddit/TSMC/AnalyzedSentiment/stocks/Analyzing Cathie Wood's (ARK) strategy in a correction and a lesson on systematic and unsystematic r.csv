,"Most of you have probably heard of Cathie Wood, or own one or more of her ETFs. ARK ETFs have won prizes in the past 2 years for the Active ETF of the year (ARKK), and most innovative ETF (ARKG). While having had an amazing 2020, with most ARK ETFs gaining 300%+ in value, in the past 2/3 months the ETFs have underperformed the market (-0.09% YTD for ARKK vs 11.92% YTD for the S&P 500 Total Return, and -4.89% YTD for ARKG vs 10.27% YTD for the MSCI World Net total return1) seeing drops of 20%+. This is due to a quick rise in interest rates, initiating a mostly institutional rotation to value stocks, as growth stocks their valuations come down more compared to value stocks due to an increase of the discount rate for future earnings as one of the most important reasons. This valuation-reset is in my opinion very justified. First, let’s look at the financial theory of classification of risk. Investment risks affecting the valuation of asset values can be categorized in two types of risk. Systematic and Unsystematic risk. Systematic risks, also known as market risks, are risks that can affect an entire economic market overall or a large percentage of the total market. Market risk is the risk of losing investments due to factors, such as political risk and macroeconomic risk, that affect the performance of the overall market. Market risk cannot be easily mitigated through portfolio diversification. Other common types of systematic risk can include interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, country risk, and sociopolitical risk. The way the sensitivity to systematic risk is measured, is by looking at the beta coefficient. The beta coefficient can measure the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. In statistical terms, beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each of these data points represents an individual stock's returns against those of the market as a whole (Thus, the market has a beta of 1. > 1 = more sensitive to systematic risk than the average of the total market, 0 > β < 1 = less sensitive to systematic risk than the average of the total market. Beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market. Unsystematic risk, also known as specific risk or idiosyncratic risk, is a category of risk that only affects an industry or a particular company. Unsystematic risk is the risk of losing an investment due to company or industry-specific hazard. Examples include a change in management, a product recall, a regulatory change that could drive down company sales, and a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take away market share from a company. Investors often use diversification to manage unsystematic risk by investing in a variety of assets. However, what is ARK’s / Cathie’s strategy in these volatile times? Let’s take a look at this interview of Cathie Wood with CNBC on the 17th of Februari, 2021: Click here (Time: 5.34 – 8.30) She gets asked whether she holds any cash in case a valuation reset happens. Her answer is very interesting: “We use it”. Now, how does an ETF like ARK actually make use of short-term volatility due to systematic risk? “The last 6 months we have been expanding the number of names in our portfolio, as a bull market extends. In some ways it’s a tax efficient strategy. What we will do during a severe correction, like the corona virus crisis presented, we will sell names which are creating losses now, to buy our highest conviction names. Some of the names we have been moving into are the bigger biotech names, Regeneron, Novartis, Takeda. We think of them as cash like. We’re using them as cash-like instruments in some way, because we will move back into our pure play names when we get into a severe correction. We use corrections toggling back and forth. Right now, our flagship portfolio has roughly 52 names in it, at the low point in the corona virus last year it was as low as 33 I believe.” Now, ARK ETFs consists of portfolios of many highly speculative stocks. Some of them without even having earnings, some of them with small market caps, negative cash flows etc. I’m not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, yet most stocks in their portfolios are volatile stocks with high beta’s, which means they are very sensitive to systematic risks. ARKK has a beta of 1.65, ARKG has a beta of 1.63 and ARKF has a beta of 1.23 (and thus got hit less compared to ARKG and ARKK by the market volatility of the past few months). So how does she toggle back and forth? When she expects a correction is coming soon, she sells many of her positions in smaller companies that are very sensitive to market risk and invests that money into bigger names that have lower beta’s. She called a few big biotech names already, such as Regeneron (β = .19), Novartis(β = .51) and Takeda(β = 1.17), yet she also did this with PayPal (β = 1.15), Lockheed Martin (β = .98), TSMC (β = 1.00) and many others (which are all relatively low beta compared to other companies in their funds). Theoretically, let’s say that due to systematic risk, an entire sector drops 10%. Stocks with a beta of 2 (her pure play stocks) would go down (2 x 10%) 20%, while stocks with a beta of .5 (deep value stocks) would only go down (.5 x 10%) 5%. She sees these stable companies as “cash-like instruments”, or deep value stocks. These deep value stocks are large, established companies, which she believes has a positive future ahead anyway, yet for the long term does not deliver attractive enough growth compared to what she wants to achieve in her fund. Now that the correction happened and when a recovery is expected, she sells these deep value stocks for only a 5% loss. She then buys her “pure play stocks” with this money, which went down 20%. Doing this, she is effectively buying back her stocks that she sold earlier at a cheaper price. Obviously this is purely theoretical, yet you can see the application of this strategy as well. Now, this only works if she is able to time a correction in the market relatively well. If she is too far off, the pure play stocks could already have grown so much that the stock price after a 20% correction would still be above the price that she could've bought in earlier. Here you can graphically see the holdings of ARK funds over time. It’s clear that she is selling shares (not just normal ETF rebalancing). For example, look at the graph of PYPL, TSM, REGN and AMZN. You can see she has been selling them when the markets went down in the end of February and March. She then moved that money into her pure plays that dropped more heavily, such as TDOC and FATE. But theory isn't practice. TDOC does not have a high beta, while FATE does. What they both have in common though, is that they all went down very hard in February / March. It also does not have to be just because of a market wide correction. For example, Cathie has been buying lots of U after the drop in February, which was the consequence of a financial report indicating growth that did not meet the expectations of investor. So why does she not just hold cash? Funds are usually not allowed and or incentivized to hold large amounts of cash, and neither would that be efficient. Trying to exactly time the market usually does not work out. By being in the market (albeit with less risky plays) you still get a return on your investment. This is more of a hedge in her portfolio against a correction. Do I recommend this tactic for the average investor? No, timing the market is very difficult, and even big institutions struggle with this. However, it is good to understand the strategy behind these plays. You could however always adopt such a strategy by allocating a certain amount of cash to a relatively safe company in the same sector, using it in the way I outlined above. There are obviously risks, such as not timing the correction well enough, and the risk of the ""deep value"" stocks dropping. However, i believe that everyone should hold a small percentage of their portfolio in cash on the sideline, if a severe correction happens (like last year). In the end, even though theory does not match practice perfectly, we can definitely see the theoretical reasoning behind her strategy. The more general takeaway is that she uses these deep value stocks as a hedge against a correction, while still generating a return on investment. She then uses the cash to buy stocks she believes in long term which went down due to short term price fluctuations, whether due to systematic risk or unsystematic risk, depending on the company itself. 1 I know comparing a genomics ETF to a total world benchmark, and an innovation fund to the S&P 500 returns is not fair, yet it’s more of an example to show the underperformance of these sectors as the effects of the rising interest rates hit these sectors comparatively harder than others (of which some underperformed last year for example) To read more about the theory of what I wrote about above, have a look at the links below. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp","Thanks for the post, and for getting her name right 😜",0,nan,nan,nan

Here you can graphically see the holdings of ARK funds over time. It’s clear that she is selling shares (not just normal ETF rebalancing). For example, look at the graph of PYPL, TSM, REGN and AMZN. You can see she has been selling them when the markets went down in the end of February and March. She then moved that money into her pure plays that dropped more heavily, such as TDOC and FATE. But theory isn't practice. TDOC does not have a high beta, while FATE does. What they both have in common though, is that they all went down very hard in February / March. It also does not have to be just because of a market wide correction. For example, Cathie has been buying lots of U after the drop in February, which was the consequence of a financial report indicating growth that did not meet the expectations of investor. So why does she not just hold cash? Funds are usually not allowed and or incentivized to hold large amounts of cash, and neither would that be efficient. Trying to exactly time the market usually does not work out. By being in the market (albeit with less risky plays) you still get a return on your investment. This is more of a hedge in her portfolio against a correction. Do I recommend this tactic for the average investor? No, timing the market is very difficult, and even big institutions struggle with this. However, it is good to understand the strategy behind these plays. You could however always adopt such a strategy by allocating a certain amount of cash to a relatively safe company in the same sector, using it in the way I outlined above. There are obviously risks, such as not timing the correction well enough, and the risk of the ""deep value"" stocks dropping. However, i believe that everyone should hold a small percentage of their portfolio in cash on the sideline, if a severe correction happens (like last year). In the end, even though theory does not match practice perfectly, we can definitely see the theoretical reasoning behind her strategy. The more general takeaway is that she uses these deep value stocks as a hedge against a correction, while still generating a return on investment. She then uses the cash to buy stocks she believes in long term which went down due to short term price fluctuations, whether due to systematic risk or unsystematic risk, depending on the company itself. 1 I know comparing a genomics ETF to a total world benchmark, and an innovation fund to the S&P 500 returns is not fair, yet it’s more of an example to show the underperformance of these sectors as the effects of the rising interest rates hit these sectors comparatively harder than others (of which some underperformed last year for example) To read more about the theory of what I wrote about above, have a look at the links below. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp","This doesn’t really relate to the post above but;It depends on your risk tolerance and your age. If we look at ARK’s ETF’s as an example of growth ETF’s, we can see that in the February correction most ARK funds lost 20%/30%. Now, we don’t know how long it will take before it reaches new highs (and if it even will, while highly likely). If you’re already quite old and need the money soon, then you may not have the time to wait for a rise again. However, if you’re young, it doesn’t matter in the long run, and this dip should present a nice buying opportunity. You should also think about your risk tolerance when choosing an ETF, and what percentage of your portfolio you want them to be.",1,nan,nan,nan
