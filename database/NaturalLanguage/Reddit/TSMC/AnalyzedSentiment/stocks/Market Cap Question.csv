,"I'm looking at market cap of different stocks on RH and on Google and Yahoo Finance. I noticed that the market cap numbers on RH and Google/Yahoo Finance were the same since Friday--BUT looking at TSM (TSMC) now, I noticed that Google and Yahoo Finance had the market cap $54 billion lower than what RH has ($494 billion on RH and $439.98 billion on Google and Yahoo finance). Since all the other stocks I've checked had similar marketcap, but TSM had a huge discrepancy...does this mean that TSM is about to experience a blood bath tomorrow or am I missing something?",No bloodbath. RH market cap numbers are off sometimes. Yahoo and google numbers are what you should rely on.,0,nan,nan,nan

Meaning there will be small variances because the price per share obviously would be different in those 3 approaches.I wouldnâ€™t worry about it either way, just be consistent in which one you use.",0,nan,nan,nan

They really do not have a department using contractors.Yahoo finance has been around 23 years and content is fairly credible.,0,nan,nan,nan
