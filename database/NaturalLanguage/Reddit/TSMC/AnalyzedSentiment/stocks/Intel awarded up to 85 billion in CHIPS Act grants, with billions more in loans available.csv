,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html The White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil. Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan. Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026. Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing. The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters. “Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.” GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026. Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing. The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters. “Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.” GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. TSMC is expected to receive CHIPS Act funds for a fab in Arizona that will be used for Apple and AMD chips.","It is not a freaking bailout. Intel has cash to do what they wish to do. But building fabs in the USA and hiring Americans will be EXPENSIVE, so there are grants and loans and guarantees for Intel. Intel without subsidies would just as soon do the whole thing in the Philippines or Thailand where costs are WAY LESS. But the Pentagon pulled their part of the money cause they want their OWN US controlled FAB for super advanced and hardened chips for US Defense and NATO.",2,nan,nan,nan

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology.

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan. Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html The White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil. Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan. Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026. Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing. The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters. “Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.” GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing. The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters. “Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.” GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology.

Do you think shareholders want Intel to push opening the Fab when they don’t have orders to actually use the fabs capacity? Pay for the personnel, the idle machines, etc? Just to say, see we got it done by 2025.As we already mentioned, construction is not delayed beyond 2026. It’s the manufacturing that’s delayed till 2027. You need chips to manufacture. They won’t have significant orders until 18A. 2025 target was hoping more market for Intel 3 process. But looks like it’s 18A or bust. Which is why nailing the 5 nodes in 4 years is what counts.

A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan. Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026. Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing. The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters. “Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.” GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan. Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon.

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday.

Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html The White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil. Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm. Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device. TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan. That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan. Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026. Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing.

Semi Fabs are Notoriously some of the most complex and difficult construction projects in the world.You say, just move the lithography machines!! The US government does not own the lithography machines, TSMC does, and they cannot force TSMC to move them out of their fabs. As you mentioned fabs take years to build, so where exactly would they be moving this equipment? That move in itself would destroy what a huge portion of the world semiconductor manufacturing capacity because there would be no place to put the machines.In terms of timeline, the fabs in Arizona, and Ohio, and New Mexico, are already under construction or partly operational. The goal is to have them up and running before a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.The “only reason” is a massively good/important reason!! The whole world runs on semiconductors these days and our access to leading edge. Semiconductors is vital for our existence at this point.",1,nan,nan,nan

Ask any fab manager what the most critical piece of equipment is. The fab building can be built in under a year. The equipment has huge lead times. The lithography equipment is by far the most expensive and most advanced equipment in a fab. That is why it is always the bottleneck to fab output. There are US manufacturers that could move their advanced litho equipment out of Taiwan right now if there was enough incentive to do so.,2,nan,nan,nan
