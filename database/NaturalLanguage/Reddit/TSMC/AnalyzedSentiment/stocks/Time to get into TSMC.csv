To get such big position maybe Buffet has to give a üëç, but the way it works at Berkshire, each of them have their own ""Folio"". Ted and Todd aren't Buffet's bitch analysts, they manage their own stocks within Berkshire. Note Ted and Todd are probably been given permission for bigger allocations since they are on the doorstep to manage the whole thing, sooner or not too later.If you want to get in ""because Buffet bought it"", take a step back. It's most likely not him.",0,nan,nan,nan
