,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?","I'd be too scared of Chipzilla to invest in any company that tries to compete against Intel. The history of computing is 50+ years of Intel forcing all of its competition to exit the market for microprocessors despite better designs, because Intel is engineering-driven, constantly pushing fab technologies forward, and better fabbing gives you better performance than smart design. Oddly, Intel's leadership in chip fab has only been getting stronger in the last few years.As long as Intel maintains their lead in manufacturing and engineering, I don't know how any company that tries to fight them has a bright future. Nvidia will never pull ahead in the race long enough to prosper. If they make too much money, Intel will focus its attention on beating the crap out of them - exactly what Intel is starting to do to ARM. So Nvidia can, at best, stay off their radar and/or keep up with Intel until they make a big mistake that wipes them out. This is basically what happened to Digital, MIPS, SGI, HP, Cyrix, Sun, IBM, and is now happening to AMD. I don't think Nvidia today is all that much smarter than all these other companies I've listed in their prime.",0,nan,nan,nan

Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?","You seem to be confusing the amount of crossover between Nvidia's and intel's products. The bread and butter of Nvidia's business is dedicated graphics processing, a market which it has long shared with ATi (now under AMD), and a market Intel has never mastered. Intel is making new inroads into this market with GPU-on-CPU technology, but this makes Intel the interloper on an established Nvidia position rather than the other way round. What's more, this technology is primarily aimed at the budget end of the market, so even if it is massively successful in future (it is still an under utilized concept), it still wouldn't displace Nvidia from the market.It is in fact AMD's GPU-on-CPU technology I would be most interested in, particularly since they have taken over ATi and have much more in house expertise and experience when it comes to graphics processing. AMD also are firmly entrenched in the budget end of the CPU market, which is where such technology is likely to take off.",1,nan,nan,nan

Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?","I guess you and I have different perspectives on the computing industry. 20-30 years ago, Intel's competitors said Intel only made desktop processors and could never compete in servers (Digital), graphics workstations (SGI) or mainframe (IBM) markets. The history of computing is one of convergence, where different market sectors slam into each other and merge together over time. Ask anyone in the industry and they will tell you that Moore's Law has resulted in so much space on a chip die that lately Intel and AMD have integrated more and more functionality onto the CPU and still have room to spare for graphics processor capabilities.There are significant technical advantages to having your graphics processing on the same chip as your main processor elements. Nvidia may have started in graphics but their future is in all the places that Intel already dominates (desktop/server) or wants to be (mobile). If Nvidia were fat and happy being just in graphics, they wouldn't have tried to make an x86 chip and wouldn't have spent a gazillion dollars creating an ARM-based desktop and server processor with integrated GPU that will run Windows 8 - competing directly with Intel. Unlike you, even Nvidia doesn't believe that the future has a GPU separate from the CPU. It's all going to be on the same chip. Regardless of their history, Nvidia are now going directly head to head with Intel, or trying to. Do you really think Intel is going to let them do that without a fight? Nvidia may do ok for awhile (2-3 years?), but long-term they are heading into some really serious trouble.Nvidia is at a really dangerous place. They are promoting an alternative ARM-based general computing platform to Intel and AMD because Nvidia has no legal way to sell an x86 chip today. Are you sure you understand the strategic direction of the company?http://semiaccurate.com/2010/08/17/details-emerge-about-nvidias-x86-cpu/http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/nvidias-project-denver-cpu-puts-the-nail-in-wintels-coffin/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Denverhttp://blogs.nvidia.com/2011/01/project-denver-processor-to-usher-in-new-era-of-computing/http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2012-05-22/nvidia_works_on_cpu_co-dependency_issues_with_kepler_gpu.html",2,nan,nan,nan
