,Anyone bullish or bearish on tsmc? They seem to be interested in memory now.,"I’m long TSM. They don’t get as much attention as INTEL or AMD (or heck even MU), but I think they are the key to AMD and AAPL. They are at the forefront of technology and have a monopoly because no one else is able to replicate the 7nm technology (at the moment that I’m aware of).
