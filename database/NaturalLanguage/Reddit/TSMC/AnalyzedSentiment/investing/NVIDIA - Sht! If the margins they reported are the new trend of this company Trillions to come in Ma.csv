The speed of revenue and margins growth is just spectacular.Btw, I wouldn't use the FCF as a ROI to test the pricing level. Market generally works on forward PE and at this growth level, it isn't a crazy valuation. Think about those companies who are in the PE ratio above 30 or 40 that are as shitty as you can imagine (you have a long list), and then compare to what Nvidia represents in the current world we live in.You have the highest margins in the tech sector now being printed not in Apple, MSFT or Google, it is in a hardware company, Nvidia. I am not saying that this is a buy, I am just saying that the rate of rev and marings increase in just 2 quarters for a mature company like Nvidia (come on, it is not a startup) is A M A Z I N G.Literally, as we speak, it has no close competitor in the field of AI. Yes, they will come soon, but as we speak, Nvidia is the winner in this race.Now, if any of the following quarters you see any slowdown in the growth rate (not saying that if goes negative, just a slowdown to single digit growth) you will see the stock price crashing as it would signal the end of its hegemony or demand not far from being at the peak.",1,nan,nan,nan
