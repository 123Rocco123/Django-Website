,Looks good to me.,"TSMC has a market cap of 218 billion dollars... They're not hidden.Great company, but definitely not hidden. They're just not a Reddit memestock. Don't make the mistake in thinking that companies that don't get beaten to death on here are ""hidden"".",0,nan,nan,nan

,Looks good to me.,"Having some expertise in the electronics field, I strongly prefer Vishay ( $VSH ), Kemet ( $KEM ), and Analog Devices ( $ADI ). TSMC offers a pretty limited selection of IC's and their documentation is vastly lacking compared to ADI. Compared to Vishay, the operating parameters on the goods produced by TSMC makes them inapplicable to high end goods; when a single zener diode requires 1.5% more power and the device you are making has 20 of them, the battery life goes to shit.Kemet is the industry standard for high quality capacitors/resistors/inductors in most consumer electronics with the exception of electrolytic capacitors for which I would say Nichicon is significantly ahead.",0,nan,nan,nan
