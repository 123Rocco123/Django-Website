,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO.

Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. We compete with integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support.Our primary competitors in the wired infrastructure segment are Cavium Inc., Intel Corp., Finisar Corp., GlobalFoundries, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd., Lumentum Operations LLC, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Marvell Corp., Mediatek Inc., Mellanox Technologies, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Quantenna Inc., ST Microelectronics N.V., and Sumitomo Corporation. We compete based on the strength of our high speed proprietary design expertise, our customer relationships, and broad product portfolio.Our primary competitors in the wireless communications segment are Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Skyworks Solutions, Inc., and TDK-EPC Corporation. We compete based on our expertise in FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration and proprietary material processes.Our competitors in the enterprise storage segment include Cavium Inc., Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., Microsemi Corp., and Texas Instruments, Inc. We compete based on our expertise in multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design.Our primary competitors in the industrial & other segment are Analog Devices, Inc., Cree, Inc., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, Renesas Electronics Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.

Acquiring BRCM was a good thing because it added significant growth as the wireless segment offers wireless connectivity, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, custom analog handset solutions, FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filters, and power amplifiers. These are expensive products and are largely used in high-end phones and tablets. Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF) are its key customers, accounting for over 20% of its revenue.But as good as this business is, it is also seasonal as the demand for their products from the makers of high-end phones and tablets ramps significantly prior to the introduction of the new device. As a result, Broadcom’s revenue grows significantly one quarter before Apple’s revenue grows because Broadcom supplies a large amount of semiconductor content for Apple’s iPhones. Many investors know this and will buy AAPL and AVGO as well as other suppliers before the results of the qtr that include the introduction of the new phone as a result.Solid company and a PEG of .88 makes me a believer for the longer term. If if I get the opportunity to buy at around 240 I may. As I'm overweight tech as it is, I'd be more inclined to sell some tech I have now to raise the cash rather than increase my weighting.",0,nan,nan,nan

Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale.

Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

Names that have come in, down to levels that look attractive to me as people rotate from one sector that's been doing well to other sectors that look cheaper. I've added to some names that have had a pull back due to comments by some that to me, don't look to be a concern but an opportunity. At times I've added to names like JPM, CVX, LUV, TTWO, NVDA, HD.Along the way, I've taken some profits to lock in some gain but primarily to raise cash. I sold PEP although I like Indra Nooyi and respect how she's built the snack business. But concerns I have seeing more and more communities impose taxes on sugar added drinks together with the recent disappointment with the snack business have raised doubts in me as to whether PEP really is an Oasis in the desert that's the center aisles of the supermarket. I don't know but I do know that consumer packaged goods is too hard for me now to figure out.",2,nan,nan,nan
