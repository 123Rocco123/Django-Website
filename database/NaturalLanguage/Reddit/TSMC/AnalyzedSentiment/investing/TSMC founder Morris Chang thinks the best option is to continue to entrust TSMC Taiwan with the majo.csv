They are building a fab in Japan and are in talks with Germany.Taiwan is of great strategic importance to the West. But there isn't evidence that Taiwan is using TSMC as bargaining chip for military protection. You say they don't want to spend a few billion on factories in the US for this reason, but you have the facts wrong, because they are spending many billions of dollars to construct plants in the US.

The bill addresses a lot of points of “resiliency” but TSMC moving additional production outside of Taiwan doesn’t remove them from Taiwanese geopolitical bs.The US government ideally would like a US company like Intel and Nvidia to take off and take over a larger percentage of semiconductor production for other US companies.To my knowledge TSMC does all the production of A and M Apple chips as well as a lot of US automaker chips.,3,nan,nan,nan
