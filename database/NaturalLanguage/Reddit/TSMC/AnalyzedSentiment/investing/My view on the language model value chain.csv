,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications.

It's all just probabalistic text prediction.It works well enough when you ask questions whose answers are likely baked into the training data. Like if I ask ""is a weasel a mammal"" I expect all chatbots to get it right because their training data is full of ""a weasel is a mammal"". But this isn't the type of higher-level thinking they're being advertised as being capable of, and there's an obvious attempt to avoid having discussions like these and just pretend that everything can be solved with more GPU's, more energy, more subsidies, more stolen data, etc.",2,nan,nan,nan
