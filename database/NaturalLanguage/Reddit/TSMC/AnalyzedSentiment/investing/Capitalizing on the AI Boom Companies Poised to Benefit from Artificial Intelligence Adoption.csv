,"Microsoft, fueled by growth in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence offerings, has surpassed analysts' expectations with a profit of $18.3 billion ($2.45 per share vs. $2.23 exp.) on revenue of $52.9 billion. The market has responded, sending the company's stock up by 8%. So, who else might ride the ""AI wave"" to success? Keep an eye on: Graphics card manufacturers. GPU-based solutions are effective for AI training, so AMD and Nvidia expect increased demand in the data center segment. Chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung. Server SSDs and other equipment producers will also see growth in demand. Cloud AI service providers: These companies offer AI training and support services. In addition to Microsoft's Azure AI, consider Amazon Web Services and IBM Automation. And of course, don't count out Google, which boasts a powerful cloud service. Organizations without in-house AI computing power, from research labs to online retailers, will rely on these providers. And we've just recently seen Google Bard, a chatbot that has yet to conquer the market. Cybersecurity companies: AI isn't all good – it can be used maliciously too. As AI becomes more accessible, cyber threats will increase, boosting demand for companies that combat them effectively. Potential beneficiaries could include Cisco, Cloudflare, and Gen Digital.

Nvidia focused on supporting AI on their GPUs early on with software like CUDA. I don't see AMD making effective moves on that front. Intel has been trying and maybe we'll see some good support for using INTC GPUs in AI - I think a lot of support is there already in their OneAPI. (TL;DR: I think INTC is maybe a bit better play here than AMD)Don't forget that MSFT has a $10B in vestment in OpenAI, so buying MSFT is the only way of investing in OpenAI right now since OpenAI is not publicly traded.
