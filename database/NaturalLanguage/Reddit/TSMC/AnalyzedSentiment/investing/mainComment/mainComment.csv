nan,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
nan,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

nan,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
nan,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

nan,I am going all in on ASML. I am an engineer and the systems they are creating are crazy. Crazy amount of engineering knowledge in this big machines. ASML produces machines that ultimately create CPUs out of silicon. ASML has a market share of over 60%. Intel and TSMC and other foundaries are customers of ASML. I think they are a safe bet and just wanted to tell you guys. And yes I am obviously biased so take it with a grain of salt.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

nan,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis. If you, too, want to become a well-informed investor and deepen your understanding of the world’s top companies, consider joining TDI-Premium.

nan,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers. Is it just a coincidence all these events are happening at the same time? https://www.ad.nl/veldhoven/onvervangbare-topman-asml-mogelijk-over-twee-jaar-weg~af61dcbe/ https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2022/03/asml-says-chip-makers-face-a-two-year-shortage-of-key-machinery/ https://www.eetimes.com/chiplets-get-a-formal-standard-with-ucie-1-0/ https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-ceo-says-interested-exploring-chip-manufacturing-with-intel-2022-03-23/ https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-seeks-approval-double-authorized-shares-8-bln-2022-04-08/",0.5376,NEGATIVE,1.0
nan,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading. In this article, we only talked about a small part of our full ASML analysis. If you want to get access to Part 1 & Part 2 of the ASML analysis, we would love to welcome you on our TDI-platform.

nan,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

nan,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

nan,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said.

nan,"The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

nan,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow.

nan,"This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

nan,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour?

I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too!

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

nan,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful.

They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale.

Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

nan,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
nan,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

nan,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

nan,"Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

The White House met with top CEOs from around the globe who seek a piece of the pie.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures.

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Huawei Caught Cheating on Mobile Benchmarks.csv,"Provided example is Honor Play phone, which has benchmark (""BM"") detection (think VW emissions scandal, but reverse goal).

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.9926
NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing).

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0
"Samsung estimates Q4 profit UP 50%!! Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

stockAday Applied Materials matters AMAT.csv,"When you dig deep into the technology of every phone / laptop or tv, there's a big chance you'll find AMAT. Is it worth the digging? Key Stats for Applied Materials, Inc. Ticker AMAT Sector Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing Latest price $41.31 Value $44,393M Daily vol $456M Date 03 July 2017 Links SEC Filings, www.appliedmaterials.com 1. Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Applied Materials, Inc. $12,942M 26% 36% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML Holding NV (ADR) $8,459M 35% 15% Lam Research Corporation $7,215M 26% 23% KLA-Tencor Corp $3,461M 39% 116% Qorvo Inc $3,033M 27% 0% Teradyne, Inc. $1,779M 25% 0% Clients Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest. Valuation Size Forecast PE Long-term Growth Dividend Yield FCF Yield AMAT.O $44,393M 13x 26% 1% 8% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML.O $57,243M 30x 21% 1% 5% LRCX.O $22,814M 14x 24% 1% 8% KLAC.O $14,345M 16x 12% 2% 9% QRVO.O $8,053M 11x 15% 0% 8% TER $5,974M 16x 8% 1% 2% Clients TSM $177,968M 16x 15% 4% 14% MU.O $33,034M 6x N/A 0% 18% INTC.O $158,882M 12x 8% 3% 15% 3. Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Huawei Caught Cheating on Mobile Benchmarks.csv,"Provided example is Honor Play phone, which has benchmark (""BM"") detection (think VW emissions scandal, but reverse goal).

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.9926
NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing).

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0
"Samsung estimates Q4 profit UP 50%!! Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

stockAday Applied Materials matters AMAT.csv,"When you dig deep into the technology of every phone / laptop or tv, there's a big chance you'll find AMAT. Is it worth the digging? Key Stats for Applied Materials, Inc. Ticker AMAT Sector Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing Latest price $41.31 Value $44,393M Daily vol $456M Date 03 July 2017 Links SEC Filings, www.appliedmaterials.com 1. Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Applied Materials, Inc. $12,942M 26% 36% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML Holding NV (ADR) $8,459M 35% 15% Lam Research Corporation $7,215M 26% 23% KLA-Tencor Corp $3,461M 39% 116% Qorvo Inc $3,033M 27% 0% Teradyne, Inc. $1,779M 25% 0% Clients Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest. Valuation Size Forecast PE Long-term Growth Dividend Yield FCF Yield AMAT.O $44,393M 13x 26% 1% 8% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML.O $57,243M 30x 21% 1% 5% LRCX.O $22,814M 14x 24% 1% 8% KLAC.O $14,345M 16x 12% 2% 9% QRVO.O $8,053M 11x 15% 0% 8% TER $5,974M 16x 8% 1% 2% Clients TSM $177,968M 16x 15% 4% 14% MU.O $33,034M 6x N/A 0% 18% INTC.O $158,882M 12x 8% 3% 15% 3. Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Huawei Caught Cheating on Mobile Benchmarks.csv,"Provided example is Honor Play phone, which has benchmark (""BM"") detection (think VW emissions scandal, but reverse goal).

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.9926
NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing).

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0
"Samsung estimates Q4 profit UP 50%!! Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

stockAday Applied Materials matters AMAT.csv,"When you dig deep into the technology of every phone / laptop or tv, there's a big chance you'll find AMAT. Is it worth the digging? Key Stats for Applied Materials, Inc. Ticker AMAT Sector Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing Latest price $41.31 Value $44,393M Daily vol $456M Date 03 July 2017 Links SEC Filings, www.appliedmaterials.com 1. Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Applied Materials, Inc. $12,942M 26% 36% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML Holding NV (ADR) $8,459M 35% 15% Lam Research Corporation $7,215M 26% 23% KLA-Tencor Corp $3,461M 39% 116% Qorvo Inc $3,033M 27% 0% Teradyne, Inc. $1,779M 25% 0% Clients Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest. Valuation Size Forecast PE Long-term Growth Dividend Yield FCF Yield AMAT.O $44,393M 13x 26% 1% 8% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML.O $57,243M 30x 21% 1% 5% LRCX.O $22,814M 14x 24% 1% 8% KLAC.O $14,345M 16x 12% 2% 9% QRVO.O $8,053M 11x 15% 0% 8% TER $5,974M 16x 8% 1% 2% Clients TSM $177,968M 16x 15% 4% 14% MU.O $33,034M 6x N/A 0% 18% INTC.O $158,882M 12x 8% 3% 15% 3. Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Huawei Caught Cheating on Mobile Benchmarks.csv,"Provided example is Honor Play phone, which has benchmark (""BM"") detection (think VW emissions scandal, but reverse goal).

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.9926
NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing).

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0
"Samsung estimates Q4 profit UP 50%!! Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

stockAday Applied Materials matters AMAT.csv,"When you dig deep into the technology of every phone / laptop or tv, there's a big chance you'll find AMAT. Is it worth the digging? Key Stats for Applied Materials, Inc. Ticker AMAT Sector Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing Latest price $41.31 Value $44,393M Daily vol $456M Date 03 July 2017 Links SEC Filings, www.appliedmaterials.com 1. Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Applied Materials, Inc. $12,942M 26% 36% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML Holding NV (ADR) $8,459M 35% 15% Lam Research Corporation $7,215M 26% 23% KLA-Tencor Corp $3,461M 39% 116% Qorvo Inc $3,033M 27% 0% Teradyne, Inc. $1,779M 25% 0% Clients Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest. Valuation Size Forecast PE Long-term Growth Dividend Yield FCF Yield AMAT.O $44,393M 13x 26% 1% 8% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML.O $57,243M 30x 21% 1% 5% LRCX.O $22,814M 14x 24% 1% 8% KLAC.O $14,345M 16x 12% 2% 9% QRVO.O $8,053M 11x 15% 0% 8% TER $5,974M 16x 8% 1% 2% Clients TSM $177,968M 16x 15% 4% 14% MU.O $33,034M 6x N/A 0% 18% INTC.O $158,882M 12x 8% 3% 15% 3. Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Huawei Caught Cheating on Mobile Benchmarks.csv,"Provided example is Honor Play phone, which has benchmark (""BM"") detection (think VW emissions scandal, but reverse goal).

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.9926
NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing).

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0
"Samsung estimates Q4 profit UP 50%!! Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

stockAday Applied Materials matters AMAT.csv,"When you dig deep into the technology of every phone / laptop or tv, there's a big chance you'll find AMAT. Is it worth the digging? Key Stats for Applied Materials, Inc. Ticker AMAT Sector Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing Latest price $41.31 Value $44,393M Daily vol $456M Date 03 July 2017 Links SEC Filings, www.appliedmaterials.com 1. Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Applied Materials, Inc. $12,942M 26% 36% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML Holding NV (ADR) $8,459M 35% 15% Lam Research Corporation $7,215M 26% 23% KLA-Tencor Corp $3,461M 39% 116% Qorvo Inc $3,033M 27% 0% Teradyne, Inc. $1,779M 25% 0% Clients Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest. Valuation Size Forecast PE Long-term Growth Dividend Yield FCF Yield AMAT.O $44,393M 13x 26% 1% 8% Picks 'n' Shovels ASML.O $57,243M 30x 21% 1% 5% LRCX.O $22,814M 14x 24% 1% 8% KLAC.O $14,345M 16x 12% 2% 9% QRVO.O $8,053M 11x 15% 0% 8% TER $5,974M 16x 8% 1% 2% Clients TSM $177,968M 16x 15% 4% 14% MU.O $33,034M 6x N/A 0% 18% INTC.O $158,882M 12x 8% 3% 15% 3. Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Huawei Caught Cheating on Mobile Benchmarks.csv,"Provided example is Honor Play phone, which has benchmark (""BM"") detection (think VW emissions scandal, but reverse goal).

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up. Do you guys think it is a good time to buy?",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.9926
NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing).

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0

Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

stockAday Applied Materials matters AMAT.csv,"When you dig deep into the technology of every phone / laptop or tv, there's a big chance you'll find AMAT. Is it worth the digging? Key Stats for Applied Materials, Inc. Ticker AMAT Sector Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing Latest price $41.31 Value $44,393M Daily vol $456M Date 03 July 2017 Links SEC Filings, www.appliedmaterials.com 1. Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp.

They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

The case for shorting Intel.csv,"While Intel has had a great run over the past decade, I believe we've reached an inflection point. They've already had to start laying off employees: https://investorplace.com/2020/01/intel-layoffs-2020-things-to-know/ With AMD breathing down their back, Intel is lowering prices on their server chips lowering profit margins which won't be coming back anytime soon: https://www.anandtech.com/show/15405/intel-cuts-xeon-prices Intel is constantly talking about how they're going to be shipping 7nm in 2021 when they have failed to get their 10nm process working for almost 4 years now past its original expected release date. It's clear Intel's process has stagnated, and their choice to stick with manufacturing their own CPUs has now turned from advantage to disadvantage as it's competitors are able to focus on design while leaving the process improvements to TSMC: https://www.pcworld.com/article/3394398/intel-commits-to-shipping-7nm-chips-by-2021-an-aggressive-change-of-pace.html I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly. As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day. All of these are reasons why I believe Intel has largely peaked as a company, and my thesis for why Intel is a good stock to go short on right now.",0.5473,NEGATIVE,0.9994
Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors.csv,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing). Manufacturing used to be core know-how but now they're 6-12 months behind TSMC on 7nm chipsets - US government blocked Broadcom's takeover attempt of Qualcomm (national security) - AMD stock performing the best in a decade - fabless company (only design no manufacturing) - NVIDIA rallying due to crypto and AI boom - ZTE and Huawei blocked in US and other countries because it's Chinese hardware. Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

Financial Times and IHS Markit said car production of Honda, Toyota, FCA, GM and Ford will slow down and lots of money are going to be lost.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before. Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news?

What are some dominant safe companies with a lot of room to grow next 3 years.csv,"Let me define: Dominant: Either on top, in a duopoly, or an extremely strong up-and-comer that is likely to take the crown. Safe: The market is likely to be fairly stable without huge downsides. Room to grow: Either in it's core market or it is entering into growing new markets where the company is likely to win. My favorite picks are: Walmart: One of the strongest lower-end consumer goods retailer. Will do well in a recession. Room to grow from its online division. With good logistics could take some market share from Amazon. Unity Software: Enjoys a duopoly in video game engines. Video and mobile games are a growing market that's not slowing down anytime soon.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery.

The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

Adoption of 5G and VR gives Unity new markets for growth. TSMC: Makes 50% of the world's chips. 5G, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing will only drive up demand. What are your picks? (household name picks are great too, but if you have some names that's not just the common FANNG+T that would be even better)",0.5497,POSITIVE,0.9973
What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it.

Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration. Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

TSMC and Intel are competing for technology leadership and preferential construction deals, while SMIC in China is still trying to catch up with the headwinds of US sanctions. The article points out that after the chip shortage and pandemic related buying there could be overcapacity as a result of the drive to chip supply independence. And that this could result in increased competitive pressures between manufacturers and countries. Are people trading/investing in the chip shortage? and who do people see as the main winners/losers?

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us. Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500.csv,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?",0.5534,NEGATIVE,1.0
Question about the stocks SMIC and TMSC (semiconductor companies).csv,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,0.5627,NEGATIVE,1.0

Semiconductor boom 2017 to continue Micron, SK Hynix, TSMC, oth.csv","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something).

"Semiconductors, the next big Tech.csv","Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago. What am I missing? Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past.

Looking at the chips Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh? They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales. Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E Revenue $8.7bn $7.5bn $9.1bn $9.7bn $10.8bn $14.2bn EPS $0.09 $0.21 $0.87 $1.12 $1.54 $3.08 DPS $0.35 $0.39 $0.40 $0.40 $0.40 $0.41 Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come?

What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful.

They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you.

The case for shorting Intel.csv,"While Intel has had a great run over the past decade, I believe we've reached an inflection point.

It's clear Intel's process has stagnated, and their choice to stick with manufacturing their own CPUs has now turned from advantage to disadvantage as it's competitors are able to focus on design while leaving the process improvements to TSMC: https://www.pcworld.com/article/3394398/intel-commits-to-shipping-7nm-chips-by-2021-an-aggressive-change-of-pace.html I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly. As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than 1b AUM.csv,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.5309,POSITIVE,0.9057
15 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks.csv,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions.csv,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes 💡Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. 💡CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. 💡US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. 💡First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. 💡Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity 💡International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks 💡Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. 💡Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",0.5426,NEGATIVE,0.9921
A rough analysis on Sony's.csv,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold, *In millions of yen Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly enter the EV space as a supplier In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&D in it. Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd. Sales for PS4 increased YOY -> convertible into PS5 sales Operating income from gaming almost doubled 64,987 -> 104,932 Gaming accounts for 23.2% -> 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES Pictures decreased by 20% Will recover after covid Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues Decrease of 34.7% $SNE owns over 50% of the market share Previously YOY increase of 25% P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth EPS last quarter $3.47 a 285.56% surprise Without PS5 sales 10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year PS5 sales 4.2 million since November. Expectations of 18 million YOY. Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles. Clearly dominates the home console market globally. At one point 3,368,098 units, while the Xbox Series X/S sold 1,817,303. PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC. Increased yield and more mature production would also drive the cost of production lower to adjust for R&D. Tl;dr Key points: Good chunk of cash to play with for innovating the EV supply side entry which would cover the sales cut from Huawei sales ban. PS5 Is a clear winner for this new generation of consoles, should dominate the home space. Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand. Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up. Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures. Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and even with current trajectory. Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week. updated",0.5561,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Apple and TSMC.csv,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

ASML An unbeatable monopoly.csv,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML. ASML engineers working on one part of a machine Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix. You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter). 1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: “Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?” They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again. We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA). ASML roadmap 2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers. These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides. ASML patents 3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable. The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts. Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible.

ASML CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares.csv,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery.

The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

ASML will succeed despite China.csv,"Last week, we extensively discussed the potential monopoly of ASML. Inevitably, one of the risks that comes up is China, which we covered in depth in our premium analysis. However, we believe China alone won’t make or break this investment. Let’s highlight three risks when we talk about China: Risk 1: “The U.S. or Dutch government can ban not only the export of EUV machines to China, but also that of DUV machines.”. ASML's largest customer in China is SMIC, the country’s most advanced semiconductor foundry. Due to export restrictions, SMIC is prohibited from using EUV machines, which prevents it from economically producing the most advanced chips (under 7 nanometers). Despite this, the U.S. is intensifying its pressure on the Netherlands to halt both the sale and maintenance of DUV machines to China. Fouquet has noted that these restrictions are ""economically motivated,"" suggesting they aim not only at security concerns but also at slowing China's economic ascent.  For now, ASML continues to supply and maintain DUV machines in China. However, if a future ban on DUV exports or maintenance is enforced, resulting in ASML losing all of its China-based revenue, the company stands to forfeit approximately 10-20% of its total revenue. While this represents a significant portion, it is unlikely to undermine the fundamental investment thesis for ASML. Risk 2: “China is investing heavily in developing its own chip industry, and it may eventually succeed in producing its own DUV or even EUV machines.”. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building its own chip industry.  SMIC, China's largest foundry, is heavily reliant on ASML’s DUV machines for production. Should China succeed in developing its own advanced lithography machine (a necessity given the export restrictions on ASML), this machine would likely only be used within China. The manufacturing processes of TSMC and other global manufacturers are so integrated with ASML’s machines that switching would not be feasible. Furthermore, it would be somewhat paradoxical for Taiwan (a country that China aims to occupy) to rely on Chinese-made machines for its most critical chip production processes. Also in this case, the total revenue loss for ASML would be 10-20% (all revenues from China). Risk 3: “If China were to occupy Taiwan, the impact would be significant, as ASML’s largest customer, TSMC, has the majority of its fabs located there.” To give you some background information: China views Taiwan as an apostate province. To understand this, we must go back to the Chinese Civil War between the communists and nationalists, which ended in 1949. The communists won the war, and the nationalists fled to Taiwan, which has since functioned as an independent entity, though not recognized as such by China. Despite the political and cultural differences between Taiwan and China, China considers Taiwan a part of its territory under the ‘One China’ policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared it a national goal to reunify the countries, which Taiwan strongly opposes. The likelihood of China invading and annexing Taiwan in the future is significant, and such an action would have dramatic consequences not only for Taiwan and ASML, but also for the rest of the world.  TSMC would no longer be able to produce chips in Taiwan, and ASML could remotely disable its machines in Taiwanese fabs through embedded software. Nevertheless, without a fully operational TSMC, the global economy would come to a halt, and ASML would also feel financial pain.  Thankfully, TSMC has not only fabs in Taiwan but also has an operational fab in Japan (with a second fab planned that will be operational by the end of 2027) and is heavily investing in fabs in the U.S. (Arizona) and Europe (Dresden). The fact is, and will be for quite some time, that most volume and the most advanced chips will be made in Taiwan. An attack on Taiwan will lead to significant problems in the value chain in nearly all electronic devices. But electronic devices, such as a refrigerator, smartphone, laptop or sound speaker, must and will be made. For that, fabs in other countries will expand heavily or must be built from the ground up. In those expanded or new fabs must be placed a lithography machine of ASML. So our prediction is that if Taiwan gets attacked by China, it will be a short term (< 3 years) problem for ASML. In the longer run, capacity must be rebuilt and ASML will still sell its machines. In our opinion: After extensive research into ASML, including a two-part analysis for our members, we believe that while China could pose serious challenges for ASML, it won’t make or break the overall investment case. China might create short-term pressures on sales growth, which has averaged 20% annually since 2018, but we believe ASML’s future looks bright. As always, thank you for reading.

Bear Theory on AMD valuation.csv,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Deep dive into the reasons behind why Intel is behind technologically.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

frontier tech portfolio.csv,"hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things: i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference. i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date. i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long-term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire. ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in: 30% AI - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each: 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here. 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT). 15% mix of these... NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that. i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30% Bitcoin - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play. 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio. 30% Space - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why: 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous. 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well. 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead. 10% cash - ...to buy them juicy dips. ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading. ***The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025.csv","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/ Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips. But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries. Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years. The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph. ""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors. Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies. In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive. Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes. Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say. ""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said. Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip. The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids. But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology. This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready. ""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

"Intel, and The Fall of an industry Titan An look into the future and past of Intel.csv","The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away. Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

My view on the language model value chain.csv,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research. Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :) Value Chain First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything. Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything. Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything. Past Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong. Present Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy. But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o. So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Future I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",0.5311,POSITIVE,0.9499
NVDA - What do you guys think.csv,"So I can't decide what to think of this company. Just a couple weeks ago I was convinced their Tegra 3 and dominance of the GPU market would lead them to at least $20 within the next year. Their GPUs are in pretty much any performance computer, including most of Apple's MacBooks. Their Tegra 3 is considered one of the top processors for mobile devices, on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip (there are plenty of benchmarks for these chips, but it seems every other one conflicts with the previous one as to which is better). They have been gaining market share over the past couple years, and with the Tegra 3 I thought they had great potential for growth. Not only that, but their cash position is almost $5 per share, so the price of $13 seems really cheap. However, things have started to look a little less peachy. Amazon's decision to go with Texas Instrument's chip was pretty surprising, and Nvidia lost out on a good amount of market share. Also, Intel's Ivy Bridge processors might slowly phase out the need for separate GPUs, which would cut into Nvidia's sales. And maybe the worst of all is that unlike Intel, Nvidia depends on TSMC to make the part for its chips, and TSMC is having huge problems meeting demand. I still think Nvidia is a relatively small company offering top-of-the-line products in a space with many bigger competitors, and therefore has plenty of room to grow. However, at the same time they could easily get crushed by a company like Intel or Qualcomm a couple years down the line if they even have a minor slip-up.

NVDA is more than an AI bubble.csv,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,0.5477,NEGATIVE,0.7455

"Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC.csv","This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and reddit, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes [1], coupled with rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million [2], while the R&D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing [3]. What is packaging? The best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking[4]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building. 3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. Chiplets Chiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.[5] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces). AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). [6]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. [7]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it – Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. [8] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market. Chiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least. 3D stacking In theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately. 3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 [9], Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago [10], and TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago [11], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.[12] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far behind.[13] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). [14] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), [11] the issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, [15]while Intel’s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. [16] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. [17] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. [10] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic – and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance. After reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future is promising is threefold. Packaging is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). [18][19] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based. Intel’s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors. If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak. Semiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.

Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position. 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

Love boring? The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is Buy. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter! Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have: Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 4. Rising tide? Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it. But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

stockAday Has Versum Materials turned VSM.csv,"I've always have a sneaking suspicion that spin-offs are better investments than rumps! So what's happened since Air Products split off $VSM? +72% versus +4% in one year. Wow. Is the trend done? Or more to come? Key Stats Ticker VSM Sector Specialty Chemicals Latest price $40.20 Value $4,374M Daily vol $22M Date 16 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Investor Deck Website versummaterials.com 1. What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years. Sept year end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $951m $853m $943m $1,009m $970m $1,114m $1,188m EPS $-0.18 $-0.74 $1.14 $1.69 $1.95 $1.91 $2.12 And looking to the balance sheet, VSM does have debt, $700m or so, equal to a ""reasonable"" 2x profits. Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend. Though it's rather small at just 5% of earnings being paid out each year. 2. Bigger / Better Elsewhere? In their 10-K they highlight a long list of competitors, though many are inside mega conglomerate chemical businesses. Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials. So it's not really that fair to sign VSM's praises, though it's margins and returns are delightful. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Versum Materials Inc $1.1bn 33% 56% Cabot Microelectronics Corporation $0.5bn 27% 16% Entegris Inc $1.3bn 23% 13% FUJIFILM Holdings Corp. (ADR) $21bn 13% 8% Air Liquide SA €18bn 25% 13% DowDuPont Inc $75bn 20% N/A Perhaps their specialization pays off. They note The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing. Because of our breadth, we believe that there are no global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. So maybe they do have a meaningful competitive advantage. If so, it's not showing in a valuation premium. The stock doesn't look expensive relative to either the US listed small caps, or the big mega-cap conglomerates.

Now that's a nice re-rating! 3. Wall Street's positive thinking Ever since the de-merger, the professionals on Wall Street have said Buy! They've ramped their target price every quarter too. Though with a current target of $40, they really aren't suggesting any short-term upside. Now, the management team has beaten estimates every quarter since IPO, there doesn't look like there is a competitive or industry headwind, so it sure feels like they are being cautious. Reasonably so? 4. Looking to 2018? So the August earnings call led to an upgrade. And a jump in the stock price. So, isn't it time to look to 2018? The markets' expecting 11% EPS growth. The end market is growing nicely, they are making productivity improvements, and as an independent company they are doing small bolt on purchases. All in all, it's a nice story. I can't see a reason to go wild about Versum, but in the same way, there's no reason to avoid it. I like it, even if it's more likely to be a long-term winner.

stockAday I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom AVGO.csv,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap! Back then we suggested we should all be Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO. Concluding: So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range. 1. So what's changed? The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice. $AVGO December today change Price $163 $246 +50% Target price $205 $283 +40% Sales forecast $13.3bn $17.6bn +30% EPS forecast $11.25 $15.91 +40% PE ratio 14x 16x +15% A quick aside Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links. Ticker AVGO Sector Semiconductors Latest price $245.99 Value $100,359M Daily vol $507M Date 11 October 2017 Financials SEC Financials Website broadcom.com 2. What's this star? It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value. Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales); Wireless Communications (28%); Enterprise Storage (17%), and; Industrial & Other (5%). And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband & telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit. A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. Shooting higher? These figures are including the big M&A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly... Oct year-end 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $2.3bn $2.5bn $4.3bn $6.8bn $13.2bn $17.6bn $19.2bn EPS $2.25 $2.19 $0.99 $4.85 $-4.86 $15.91 $17.61 DPS $0.56 $0.80 $1.13 $1.55 $1.96 $4.06 N/A In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me! Deal junkies? Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 2. Looking good or not? It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Broadcom Ltd $16,928M 40% 3% Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% QUALCOMM, Inc. $22,570M 30% 13% Texas Instruments Incorporated $14,184M 47% 40% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) $7,401M 17% 9% Qorvo Inc $2,975M 26% -1% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. $2,384M 21% 6% Skyworks Solutions Inc $3,502M 41% 26% When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x. Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation.

Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 3. Wall Street's still in love The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is Buy. It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight. 4. It's a keeper The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines. But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example: We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability. Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it.

TSMC Earnings Ahead Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs.csv,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may revise their ratings or price targets for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a spike in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors.

Adoption of 5G and VR gives Unity new markets for growth. TSMC: Makes 50% of the world's chips. 5G, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing will only drive up demand.

What did Buffett see in TSMC with US41 bln stock purchase - DigiTimes Asia.csv,"This news article from Taiwan, I think, adds perspective on the investment. TSMC was nowhere on my radar, other than noting their prominence in semiconductor manufacturing. The size of their margins is surprising: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221115VL201/tsmc.html Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei Tuesday 15 November 2022 For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision? According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR). ""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes. Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3."" Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters. As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade? ""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai. Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation."" The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock. Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies. TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently. ""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies."" TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",0.5488,NEGATIVE,0.9124
What Recession Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.csv,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality. Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn. India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China. Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor. Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH. One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example. While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several. TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this. Edit: made post a bit clearer",0.5321,POSITIVE,0.9526

What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario.csv,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",0.5362,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you.csv","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",0.5492,POSITIVE,0.9967

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108. Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.
