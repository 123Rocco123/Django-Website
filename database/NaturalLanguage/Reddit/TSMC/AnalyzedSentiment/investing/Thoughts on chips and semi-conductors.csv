,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing). Manufacturing used to be core know-how but now they're 6-12 months behind TSMC on 7nm chipsets - US government blocked Broadcom's takeover attempt of Qualcomm (national security) - AMD stock performing the best in a decade - fabless company (only design no manufacturing) - NVIDIA rallying due to crypto and AI boom - ZTE and Huawei blocked in US and other countries because it's Chinese hardware. Helped companies like Ericsson (Swedish). Guess Nokia and other non-Chinese network equipment providers will benefit from this. - China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it. This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know. Therefore I'd like to hear how the community here views this? What are your thoughts and prediction on how this will evolve. Who are the winners and losers here? I would like to increase my knowledge in the area before I take positions. I think there's a lot of risk and opportunities that still haven't been priced in here.","More food for thought: AnandTech says Apple A12 is very close to matching desktop CPUs. Can it really be long before Apple introduces their own CPUs for Mac? Especially at the low end why pay Intel a premium for an x86 chip that is mostly used for web browsing and Email? At WWDC this year Apple announced that many iOS APIs are coming to Mac. I think the writing is on the wall. I wouldn’t want to own Intel stock during any scheduled Apple event ...My money is (literally) on TSMC. All of Apple’s A12 production is occurring here. No Samsung at all, TMSC is the only one with the 7nm fabs needed for it. The stock has been hit hard along with other emerging market stocks making it a good time to buy.",0,nan,nan,nan

Had the same line of thought - but recent events makes me a bit nervous about manufacturing in/around China. Even though the hardware hack is not confirmed in any way - I see a possibility to bring manufacturing to US or Europe.,1,nan,nan,nan

There's a lot more than crypto to NVDA, despite all the headlines.No interest in INTC. Owned AVGO for a while, don't plan on owning that again.",0,nan,nan,nan

Also providing dividend and getting long term debt while some agencies expect a meltdown in the memories inventories. They fear the company is looking for trouble while debt should be kept low. Also some skepticism on whether nxpi lost focus during the Qcom issue.But other than that its a great buy for long term and now with dividend available. Investment in R&D has been increased as the company is pushing the thrust into car infotainment, 5G and AI",2,nan,nan,nan
