By conceding to using TSMC, they've finally come to grips that their manufacturing processes aren't delivering on their big-eyed promises, and they can't execute like TSM can when it comes to chip manufacturing.TSMC still stands to lose a LOT of money should Intel start to get things right on the foundry side, so it wouldn't be in their best interest to support Intel beyond a bare minimum. It would be akin to Intel helping AMD eat into their gigantic market leadership.I agree that it's definitely something to watch, but to me there's too much to lose by giving Intel access to your 3nm technology.",0,nan,nan,nan

I suspect this will probably be for some super low power laptop/tablet chips and won't get anywhere near desktop or regular laptops.

I'm from the Intel side! I think AMD side shouldn't worry too much about INTC. It's a big old ship that's getting bombarded from all sides. The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD.A plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and ""5G-cloudification"" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI & tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource.Real threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM & BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",0,nan,nan,nan
