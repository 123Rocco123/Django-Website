What's this got to do with Semis? Okay, $VSM is a specialty chemical business, but it's top clients are Intel, Samsumg and TSMC. So it's really a play on the semiconductor market! Versum has two business lines: The Materials segment is an integrated provider of specialty materials for the electronics industry, focusing on the integrated circuit and flat-panel display markets. The DS&S segment designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and maintains chemical and gas delivery and distribution systems for specialty gases and chemicals delivered directly to its customers' manufacturing tools. Now this sort of business has gotta make engineers excited! It's all about ""molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials. They note in their annual report, they've 200 scientists helping them invite new products for the semi-industry. In fact, some of VSM's inventions are key to helping with miniaturization. i.e. allowing smaller / lighter devices. Though given the Materials division is 78% of sales and 85% of profits, it seems like there's really only one key driver of VSM. And separately, the top 3 clients are nearly 50% of sales. So there's a really concentration risk. Margins getting good! So the business didn't grow in the year before it was spun out. But the margin's been getting better and better, with the earnings nearly doubling in 2 years.

Good to see that Air Products didn't saddle it with a burden when it set Versum free. Phew. And none of us will be surprise to see a dividend.

Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow Chemical, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, JSR Microelectronics, Merck EM, and SK Materials.

You'll see this quite a bit in business services, where the need for niche products can balloon into entire industries. Interesting to see Bill Ackman getting into the stock now, when arguably the most lucrative pieces of the business have already been divested.Another interesting example is the Alcoa/Arconic split, which has generated shareholder value, but arguably only because the price of aluminum has moved favorably since the IPO.",1,nan,nan,nan
