,"""... TSMC said that a batch of photoresist it used included a specific element which was abnormally treated, creating a foreign polymer in the photoresist. The problem was detected late when the wafer yields were lower than expected. As it turns out, consequences of the photoresist incident at Fab 14B were more serious than initially calculated by TSMC. There are media reports claiming that between 10,000 and 30,000 wafers were affected and had to be scrapped, but TSMC has never confirmed either of the numbers. ... In any case, the cost of the wafers totals $550 million and they will be made up in Q2. In the meantime, TSMC is pulling in ""certain production"" from Q2, which will bring in $230 million in additional revenue in Q1.

Chips were slated for delivery to Apple, Huawei, Nvidia and MediaTek, though TSM won't say what exactly was affected. Would guess October drop was probably AAPL-related, but I don't follow either company particularly closely.Extra bit of story while I'm here: ""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will seek compensation from the company that provided it with substandard raw materials resulting in several hundred million U.S. dollars in sales losses earlier this year, the world's largest contract chipmaker said Tuesday.However, TSMC declined to reveal the name of the supplier or the sum of the claim....""http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201902200016.aspx",1,nan,nan,nan
