,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch. - The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way.

Stadia has been a breath of fresh air for me recently, and I only see myself using my ps5 once more exclusives are available. Stadia is just much easier to get up and going, exit, transfer screens, family sharing, etc. All this while stadia is basically on its first public revision.Sony is much more than Sony Entertainment, with multiple revenue streams, but all this had made me realize they are about to get leapfrogged technologically, and that will have ripple effects across most of what the world associates SONY with. Their financial services, licensing, etc should remain strong, but I don't know what the future holds for their tech and gaming business.

There was a turning point at some point last year where you could tell Google was all of a sudden taking it seriously (instead of just another failed Google concept).As long as your internet connection is at least ok, it's a pretty flawless experience. There are other benefits too such as it works on every TV in my house via chromecast (nice with 4 kids who all want their own separate consoles), car rides via tablets/phones, family sharing (once you buy or activate a game everyone in your Google family has access to it.)I think most people just haven't tried it and it's still early in adoption. Even though I do feel like stadia is a newfound success for Google, they may not be the ultimate winner in this battle. Someone will though and it will be one of the companies that already have massive cloud infrastructure in place ( Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc). The tech itself is what impressed me. It works nearly flawlessly now and I see no reason to go backwards. It occurs to me that every software service could stream this way. You could develop high end animation or video editing on a 2001 Vaio laptop and it would function just as well as a brand new MacBook pro. This can essentially even the playing field across the world allowing access to top level software without needing the hardware to back it up.For what it's worth, give it a try. It's free. Madden 21 is free this weekend for everyone pro or not. Destiny 2 and bomberman are also free to try the service without spending a single penny.",2,nan,nan,nan

PS5 resales are also vastly outselling Xbox Series X resales and PS5 resale prices are higher than Xbox Series X resale prices.This leads me to believe that demand for PS5 is much higher than for Xbox Series X therefore it's a good start to set PS5 for much higher global market sahre than Xbox Series X.This is why they are getting smacked.Not sure what you're referring to.

They could put all of their first-party games on launch day on their rebranded PS Now.I believe they currently don't do so, because their first-party games have been very successful on PS4.

Customers, especially in the gaming space, know the value of owning a game.Gamepass is a renting service and its cyclic selection of games are mostly outdated.Streaming will never be the future of gaming as it is a very different industry and business model compared to music and tv shows. Its closer to movies:High cost of production, dozen publishers each with their own catalogue that would prefer to have say on their own income rather than through a streaming platform from MS.Netflix beat TV by being an on demand service than many TV pubs did not provide. Gaming has always been on demand, via individual purchasing.Average player only plays 2 games a year. Very different to music and tv shows.Sony is making more money than ever, twice as much as Xbox and growing faster than Xbox as well.Gamepass is MS's last play for Xbox, if it fails, quote me on this, Xbox as a division will be shut down or sold.People who say streaming subs are the future of gaming simply have not checked the business model.

I'm new to investing and a few weeks ago initially picked Sony as my one stock among my ETFs. I like many Sony products and the PlayStation played a formative role in my youth. But mainly, I picked Sony because of 360 Reality Audio. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless noise cancelling headphones from Back Market. These things are incredible. I was recently playing with settings for their 360 Reality Audio. The testing sounds they did blew me away. I literally turned around because it felt like a speaker was behind me. I think and hope it is an audio revolution. They are working to integrate it with more things - right now options are pretty limited. But the capabilities of it are wild.",0,nan,nan,nan

They are top dogs in the consumer and professional photo world while also have some decent stuff in the consumer cinema camera world. I think at a point Nikon was even using Sony sensors for their cameras. I feel like as the younger generation is gravitating towards Sony, the photography world will be dominated by them very soon.

Sony will never catch them when comes to the cloud.“There aren’t many details about this partnership yet, but it looks like Sony will definitely use Microsoft’s Azure cloud to power their game streaming services... The biggest take-away from this news is how much of a win it is for Microsoft. It’s this kind of mutually beneficial partnership that Satya Nadella is famous for fostering during his tenure as CEO. With this deal, Microsoft is almost guaranteed to be a contender in cloud gaming. Either Sony’s services are successful, in which case Microsoft still gets a huge chunk of their revenue via server costs. Or, the Sony services don’t catch on, leaving Microsoft’s own xCloud as a bigger winner in the streaming market. No matter what happens, Microsoft is well positioned.”",4,nan,nan,nan

Yes it’s true that Microsoft benefits in the streaming space but the entire situation is much more complex than simply using Microsoft’s services on the cloud. But we don’t know much about the underlying Sony streaming technology running on Azure (yet) which would allow me to analyze it. The only thing we can take from the situation is that Sony must be very confident in their game exclusively and PlayStation brand. After all it’s the reason the ps5/ps4 is such a succcess internationally.I also don’t think game streaming will be as big of a thing in the near future. Outside of Europe and urban parts of Asia most countries are still struggling to provide adequate internet speed without a data cap. In order for game streaming to be successful lots of things have to be in place. Mostly notably the availability of high speed low latency internet access at a cheap price AND net neutrality has to be in place.,5,nan,nan,nan

,"*Disclaimer I am not smart and my opinion is trash Sony is the most undervalued company on this planet. Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. - Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space. - There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter. -In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads. - SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength.

I personally love all of their products from earbuds, TV, PS or even their camera (their mobile might be an exception lol), but love it more as businesses especially Gaming and Imaging and Sensing Solution segments.",0,nan,nan,nan
