RKT is smashing revenue and profit results in the current environment of low rates. There is obviously some risk in this sector as interest rates will eventually go back up over the mid-long term but that will impact the whole sector not just RKT. And regardless of rates, people will always buy houses and need mortgages.One of the reasons for going public was to raise funds for acquisitions. There has also been speculation of an eventual dividend long term. Both of these events would create upside. RKT also touts itself as a fintech (not just another mortgage company); if they can deliver on this there is significant upside as the company is currently priced as if it were just a mortgage company (low PE multiple). RKT is currently just above it's IPO price point.Positions: 1,000 shares @19.60 and selling CSPs to lower my cost base. I plan on holding long term.This is not advice, do your own research, etc...Edit: typo",0,nan,nan,nan

They are a major (arguably biggest) player in the global production of agricultural inputs such as potash, nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, and other agricultural inputs. Why do I think they will do well? they are a relatively new firm ( formed in 2017 from the merger of two sector leaders Potash Corp & Agrium); which also saw the highly competent CEO of Agrium takeover as CEO of nutrien, so they should have a number of competent people in their boards making smart choices. Another reason is that the global prices of various fertilizers have been in a low dip, but fertilizer crop rotation can by cyclical, so I do not believe it is not too unrealistic to expect various agricultural actors to be consuming more of X at a later date at X price. The most important though is we all have to eat, which means producing food on an industrial scale, and this requires these essential inputs, of which Nutrien has a major market share. They also have a nice dividend of 3,75% so who can complain about that tacked on. I do see some legitimate threats as they may face political repercussions of the escalating China-Western tensions (i.e. more barriers to move their products to the attractive Chinese markets); but they are also not entirely reliant on this sector.",0,nan,nan,nan

My thoughts are because they announced a lot of things, including beating the expectations that were set for them, releasing their yearly info for investors, and towards the end their move to be the major green/carbon friendly provider of agricultural inputs. I also believe there was greater than expected demand for some of their products/service in China relating to hog farming. I could ramble on an on, but those are the highlights. Are they correct? ehh maybe, or maybe no, afterall I am just one person.I think it hard to say how you should ride the cycles as Nutrien is only 3 years old and is still getting its footing. Everybody has different positions of how long they want to hold, what their goals for investing are, so I think this is a real individual approach.

Room to grow: Either in it's core market or it is entering into growing new markets where the company is likely to win. My favorite picks are: Walmart: One of the strongest lower-end consumer goods retailer. Will do well in a recession. Room to grow from its online division. With good logistics could take some market share from Amazon. Unity Software: Enjoys a duopoly in video game engines. Video and mobile games are a growing market that's not slowing down anytime soon. Adoption of 5G and VR gives Unity new markets for growth. TSMC: Makes 50% of the world's chips. 5G, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing will only drive up demand. What are your picks? (household name picks are great too, but if you have some names that's not just the common FANNG+T that would be even better)","L Brands. I put 10% of my portfolio in them yesterday. Why?Because who can compete with them in terms of lingerie and lotions/soaps? They own Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works. I see them as a soft luxury goods company. Something that can be perceived to enhance a perceived luxurious or more perceived to be upscale lifestyle (Apple and Starbucks fits into this mold I would argue) but aren't luxury goods companies in the traditional sense (don't sell a luxury image to you, don't constrain inventory to create demand for a product, etc.). VS, VS Pink, and Bath and Body Works are absolutely killing this holiday season right now and their 10-K and most recently filed 10-Qs for this fiscal year have shown tremendous growth in Bath and Body Works (direct channel growth has been in the triple digits). I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon, if anything I see them going private one of these days.",0,nan,nan,nan
