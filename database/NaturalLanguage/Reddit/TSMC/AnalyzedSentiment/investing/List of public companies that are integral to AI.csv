They are the only ones with access to knowledge about how humans work and how to make them more productive. Enterprises will pay huge premium to reduce their costs with AI.,1,nan,nan,nan

NVDA is light years ahead of everyone else on DPUs and everything built this far has been built on their architecture.,3,nan,nan,nan

All AMZN has is customer purchase data. MSFT has linkedin, github and the second most popular operating system behind android and the second most popular search engine in bing to pull data from.",1,nan,nan,nan

The operating system does grab usage/search data and GitHub developers less than 100M. I personally think the best source of their data is gaming as they stay on-line longer.",2,nan,nan,nan

Surely microsoft can extract some data from that the same way APPL or META does. Also while Bing might not be google, they still get a ton of data from their search engine.What data is AMZN really getting from AWS? Pretty sure they would lose 99% of their customers if it turned out AMZN was looking in any of the data that AWS customers were using. For AWS security and privacy is everything.",3,nan,nan,nan

For example Microsoft are a key player in the work enterprise space (Office, Outlook, PowerPoint) which AI can be used to improve. You compare that to the likes of Google or Meta that lag behind and you can start seeing why Microsoft has a competitive edge.",3,nan,nan,nan
