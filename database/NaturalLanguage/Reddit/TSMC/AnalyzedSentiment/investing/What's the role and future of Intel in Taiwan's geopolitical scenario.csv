,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys. From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business. From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm. If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in a lot more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel. Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes. I'm reading that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended. But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive. Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's a lot I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.","You are opening a very broad topic that as you suggest, includes geography, politics and the world economy all at once. That means that, you should not feel bad about not knowing much on the topic, since in order for someone to know all these things, they need to be very high up the political ranks, imho.You are right that TSMC is strongly backed by the Taiwanese government. With my limited knowledge on the topic, I would say that is because a) obviously it brings a lot of money in the country and b) it also serves as a ""defense"" from China. Taiwan can not defend itself against China without the help of Japan and USA and it is not even sure that in case of a conflict, they will get involved. China might be militarily stronger than both of them combined, in that part of the world, so they might choose to avoid conflict. But even if they do engage, it will most probably be too late (I think that Chinese fighters need 7 minutes to reach Taiwan from the closest military bases in mainland China). If China invades, that is mainly because they want to get hold of TSMC. But TSMC will have security measures for that scenario, i.e. it destroy sensitive info, so they don't end up on the wrong hands. Hence, TSMC acts as a deterrent, in the sense that, if China wants TSMC, they need to accomplish that through diplomacy, and not through war. Lastly, it will be interesting to see if the new, pro-independence Taiwanese government, will cause China to slow down their efforts for re-unification, or if it will have the opposite effect.Regarding Intel, you need to remember that this is an industry that is moving very fast and where R&D plays a huge part. That means that if a company makes the wrong strategic decision now, they will find themselves left behind the race of manufacturing cutting-edge semiconductors a few years from now. That is what happened to Intel approximately 15-20 years ago.Intel also didn't have the constant backing of the US government, because companies in a capitalistic environment, want to have governments being involved, as little as possible. However in the past, the semiconductor industry in the US and with it also Intel, has requested support from the US government, when it realized it cannot compete with companies that are being backed up by other governments, e.g. companies in China.Intel probably does have an advantage on American soil. It will probably also have the backing of the government. The question is, can it make as advanced semiconductors as TSMC? Because the focus will still be on the company that can make the most advanced semiconductors. So, even if you set up all the infrastructure domestically, it becomes irrelevant if you lack in technology.Finally, I would strongly recommend that you read Chip War. It explains how all of the above are tangled together, while also giving a nice overview of the industry's history. It is also nice that it is written quite recently (e.g. it explains how Trump tried to slow down the development of China, through restricting exports), because you get a picture of the situation as it is now, which is quite important in such a fast-moving industry.This ended up being quite a long post. I hope I answered some of your questions.",0,nan,nan,nan
