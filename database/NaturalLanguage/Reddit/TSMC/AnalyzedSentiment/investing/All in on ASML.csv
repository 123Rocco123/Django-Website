,I am going all in on ASML. I am an engineer and the systems they are creating are crazy. Crazy amount of engineering knowledge in this big machines. ASML produces machines that ultimately create CPUs out of silicon. ASML has a market share of over 60%. Intel and TSMC and other foundaries are customers of ASML. I think they are a safe bet and just wanted to tell you guys. And yes I am obviously biased so take it with a grain of salt.

Future innovations will likely come in the form of packaging and component arrangement...which ASML is less situated to dominate in. Beyond packaging, we are then looking at more exotic substrates (GaN, Diamond?).TLDR; you are investing based on the straight line falacy at a time when the continuation of Moore’s law is running into increasingly difficult challenges.",0,nan,nan,nan
