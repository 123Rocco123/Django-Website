If earnings dropped in half and the price stayed the same, you'd still be more or less in line with the current S&P 500 P/E.",0,nan,nan,nan

And if that's the case shorting it now may lead nowhere.We're not talking about NVDA with a P/E of 60+ or AMD with a P/E of 100+. Those are priced for perfection. We're talking about a company that had a great lead for a long time and is now selling at 11 times earnings. Sure, the earnings may drop, but will the price drop accordingly? Or will it just adjust to a slightly higher P/E? Look at JNJ, for instance, it has a P/E of 23 right now.I think we all agree that Intel is not going to disappear (as a company). Their prices will have to come down given their current position with respect to competitors, but they will adjust and survive. And if the price drops some 20 or 30% (which would give you a decent gain if you're shorting it) it just starts making sense to buy it for the dividend and the low P/E for a decent blue chip.So, I'm by no means telling you you shouldn't short it. Go ahead, I'll be happy to be proven wrong. I just think it's not as clear cut a case for shorting than say ZM.",2,nan,nan,nan

I promise you I'm not being a dick or rude to you. I'll explain but I want you to understand you clearly do not understand options well enough to make money and I'm trying to save you from losing it all.For options, the BEST bet is to buy ITM options, the deeper the better. For example, the $60 tag, $60 is a clear inflection point for the stock and if the stock gets around 60 it should have a hard time going higher. So if you own a 60 option then you will likely not lose it all. As for the profit side, if the stock goes down then every option ITM makes money based on the movement. The reason it cost more is because it is a known money maker. a $60 put on this stock will almost never lose ALL of the money, maybe most.You buying $50 is hoping it will get back down to $50, me buying at 60 is a known fact that it will not go ABOVE 60 in most situations.

Instead of simply looking at the number and assuming intel is like a whole gen behind. They’re not. These numbers are marketing, there isn’t some convention for how these things are measured and there is no governing body that enforces it, it’s up to the manufacturer how they measure it. In this case Intel’s 10nm is roughly equivalent to and/tsmc 7nm. Intel is still behind in the actual roll out to the consumer, but the gap is not as wide as what you would assume.Intel also has advantages in how they manufacture their chips, and they should be able to squeeze more performance out of their chips over time than what and/tsmc will be able to do.I would not recommend shorting a technology company without doing proper research into their technology.",0,nan,nan,nan

There's nothing in the near term that would force a collapse or downsizing of that business. People got burned hard on Tesla even with the looming possibility of bankruptcy, which doesn't exist here.Manufacturing their own products is the only way forward for them. Intel has been the #1 or #2 semiconductor manufacturer since 1995, no other company could handle that demand and they've generally been rewarded with a very high gross margin relative to competitors. Their biggest risk moving forward is having to adjust their margins down to meet competitors which is a quick adjustment to make and isn't going to collapse a business.tl;dr - If you think they're set for a decline for this reason I would just avoid investing in them, but going short is maybe one of the dumbest things I've read today and I regularly surf WSB.",0,nan,nan,nan

AMD has now leap frogged Intel and their CPU performance is increasing 20% or more every generation. Apple and Nvidia seems to be slowing down now waiting for competitors to catch up but they were going ham on generational improvements. We will soon see what Nvidia has up their sleeve with Ampere as AMD starts catching up on the GPU front as well. AMD single handily put a fire in both the CPU and GPU industries previously dominated by Intel and Nvidia, and now they are starting to haul ass. I wouldn’t count out Intel yet because yesterday’s announcement was the first competitive move that Intel has done in a long time. Yes it lowers their margins, but this move to drastically lower price and enable previously locked features like hyper-thread on their lower end chips will definitely help to take back some of the market share from AMD.

They were one or two generations ahead of everyone else and this gave them such a huge advantage because each shrink in generation gives benefits in power consumption, costs and speed. This was able to tide them over even when their design sucked (ie pentium 4), so when they finally fixed their design, they completely smoked AMD.Now they are at least a generation behind. Don’t know what they can do to resolve this. If they successfully leapfrog the 10nm tech in 2021, maybe then it would be worth buying.",0,nan,nan,nan
