That way you’re not trying to time the market, and you still get to ride the gains most of the way up. It’s a good way to minimize risk, especially if you’re investing as part of a retirement plan that isn’t 10-15+ years from being your source of income.Another is dollar-cost averaging, which says you should buy in a little bit at a time as the market goes down, this way even if you lose some money on the way down, as you keep putting money in you keep dropping your average cost per share, and leaves more headroom for overall gains. This is not to say buy in every time the market takes a hit, wait for significant downward trends and when the market seems to ease away from cliff diving, put a little money into a company or fund you think is going to come out the other side healthy and strong.This is a MUCH more aggressive strategy, and really banks on either the market eventually recovering and gaining or the complete collapse of capitalism, which would mean the money is worthless anyway. I’m on the young side, so I tend to favor this strategy a little more, simply because I have the time/opportunity to make up for losses I incur right now with selling/restructuring and adding in from income through the rest of my career.There are plenty more strategies, a guy I like on YouTube runs a series called Real Life Trading, he has lessons for all levels of market investment knowledge, and helped me set up nicely in the October-December dip.",0,nan,nan,nan

Stock prices should just be temporarily dipping due to trade war fears, but ultimately should rebound, either next month or a year from now,China is in panic mode and wants to resolve this ASAP. A deal might be reached, the deal won’t be effective (chinese don’t follow rules) but it will be a political win for both sides. If a deal isn’t reached, then production should be relocating to non tariff countries in a year or whatever.Either way, the current valuations are built on a false foundation of permanency.",0,nan,nan,nan

Probably not.Tesla rides the line too closely, with money issues... I’d avoid it.If you want to own a stock, you should spend 40 hours studying it first. Understand how it’s valued, it’s people, and most importantly it’s future.Stay with monthly contributions to index fund.",0,nan,nan,nan

However I bought TSMC, I believed we still need chip. Especially all the tech companies is pushing for A.I. and IoT. I think a leading foundry like TSMC is a good buy.",1,nan,nan,nan

Would try to squeeze more out but alot of it is literally locked up.Fortunately, I would say 1/2 of the portfolio is locked into long term positions that I would probably hold through massive bear markets.But yeah im definitely pulling out",0,nan,nan,nan

But accepting you can't change history, today is normally the best time to start if you have any long time horizon.
