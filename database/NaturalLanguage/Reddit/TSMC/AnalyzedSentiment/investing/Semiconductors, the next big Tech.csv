Computers, phones, cars, appliances, etc., all have different replacement cycles and consumers and companies replace them differently under different economic conditions. Before we had a just PC and phones, but with everything literally becoming computers, all of these different cycles add together and become ""smoothed away"".I feel like l software is much more easily to disrupt compared to designing and fabricating high-end semiconductors, especially the fabrication and component.Most software apps are easy to disrupt. Many of the app-based businesses you see today with inflated stock valuations will be bought up for pennies and/or will no longer exist once money becomes more expensive again. But monopolies and near-monopolies such as Google and Amazon will be still be extremely profitable due to their network effects and economy of scale, as well as their low capital intensity. It will be extremely hard if not impossible to disrupt these companies minus for government intervention such as stricter anti-trust rules.I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives.I agree with you for the most part. While NVDA/AMD have been valued more like technology, MU is valued as a commodity stock (which makes sense since DRAM and NAND are traded like commodities). However, businesses that sell tangible products (as opposed to digital products or services) require much more capital and time to produce a product and it just doesn't scale as well. So unless these companies can sell chips at much higher margins, which would require the economics of semiconductors and/or semiconductor manufacturing technology to change, I doubt that they will be as profitable as Big Tech.In terms of investing in them, I still see them as good investments. The chip shortage has shown that there is underallocation of capital in chipmaking and as prices go up and computerization of the world continues, these companies will continuing growing at a faster pace than the rest of the market. There are quite a few technology inflections driving this forward: virtual reality, 5G/6G, new transistor and new chip architectures, computerization of everything, IoT, healthtech, increasing complexity of designing and manufacturing chips. At the same time, without the software, the chips themselves won't do anything. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the current Big Tech incumbents will successfully capture market share in these emerging technologies.",0,nan,nan,nan

The only times you see high P/E is near and/or after the bottom of memory cycles when markets are pricing in the return of demand (i.e., beginning of another growth cycle).

The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 6.6, while the forward earnings multiple stands at 5. Himax stock's price-to-sales ratio stands at 1.6.These multiples make Himax stock a steal right now as it is trading at a huge discount when compared to the S&P 500's earnings multiple of 29 and sales multiple of 3.28. “",0,nan,nan,nan

Semis have been very cyclical in the past, but it seem like they are becoming more of a necessity to building pretty much everything that even a big downturn in the economy wont have nearly the same impact it has had in the past. I feel like l software is much more easily to disrupt compared to designing and fabricating high-end semiconductors, especially the fabrication and component.",Wait hasn't always been the hot topic since like the 70's? serious speculation not trying to be snarky.,0,nan,nan,nan
,"Are semiconductor companies going to be the next version of big tech or big oil? I feel like in a lot of ways they are some kind of hybrid version of commodities and technology, especially when it comes to stuff like memory and hard drives. However with the extreme specialization resulting in monopolies/duopolies like INTC/AMD, AMD/NVDA, AMAT/LRCX, QUAL/Samsung, MU/Samsung (RAM), TSMC/NXPI, etc., it seems like they are starting to setup to be more like big tech companies where they have carved out a huge portion or all of the market share and are setup to dominate for decades. Then add in the fact that computers and chips are being put in everything from cars to toasters, it seems like these Big Semis are going to perform quite well for the foreseeable future with little competition like Verizon and AT&T a decade or two ago.
