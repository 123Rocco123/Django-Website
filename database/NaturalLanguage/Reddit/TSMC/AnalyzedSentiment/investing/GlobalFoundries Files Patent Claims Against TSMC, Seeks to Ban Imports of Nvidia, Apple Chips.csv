They barely scraped by with 14nm (using a public partnership with Samsung) and failed to obtain sufficient yields on 20nm, 10nm, and 7nm. Now the EUV litho tools on which they spent several hundred million dollars are paper weights. They're looking for any way to hang onto revenue, which is further evidenced by their sale of the Fishkill fab to ON Semiconductor and the two rounds of layoffs in 2018.",0,nan,nan,nan

By the time the defendants write their IPRs and the PTAB decided to hear them, the ITC case is already more than halfway over.That said, 36 months is a fair, if not too short, timeline because this case is almost certainly going to get a long timeline from the ITC given the number of patents. 18-20 months to ID. 3-4 months for FD. 3 months for petitions to reconsider the FD. 18 months for a Federal Circuit Appeal, then 90 days for the Presidential review period.In short, this isn't going to have a tangible impact for years.",1,nan,nan,nan
