Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips. https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/ I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply. Therefore AMD is at SIGNIFICANT RISK to geopolitics. They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months. Here is a more technical paper on transistor gate lengths being the wrong measurement.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714 Here's an article on risks of TSMC contracts which I've seen no change in this sentiment.https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-defense-department-looks-bolster-domestic-chip-manufacture-with-new-program-2020-12-18/ EDIT - additional resources: US DOD already has labeled Qualcomm as its RAMP phase 1 https://breakingdefense.com/2021/06/dod-seeks-2-3b-to-bolster-chip-making/ and guess who already cut-off AMD from that access: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/","Inversed brah, got shares and leaps.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"EDIT - added more sources Here's my bear theory on AMD: AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage. Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters. AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is.
