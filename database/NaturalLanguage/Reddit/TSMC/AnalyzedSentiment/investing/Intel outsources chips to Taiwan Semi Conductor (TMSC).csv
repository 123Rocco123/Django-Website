,"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364603-intel-places-multi-billion-dollar-wafer-order-tsmc-murthy-gone This is what shareholders have been waiting for, if you can't beat them, join them. Intel should be able to close the gap on AMD AMD cannot compete with Intel throwing billion of dollars at TMSC. Companies always will look after the bigger client. So far not much traction from major financial news, like cnbc.com. Maybe because they are too AMD invested. Might want to see if can invest in TMSC, since they pretty much have a monopoly now.","Intel said on their last Q2 call they are looking at a ""contingency plan"" which is what CNBC has reported. No other actually confirmed new has occurred so they have not reported anything else. This is old talk not new news and it won't take away from AMD",0,nan,nan,nan

Lisa Su has been leading the AMD renaissance since before TSMC became the leading fab. Intel's leadership and executions have been relatively poor on the other hand.TSMC doesn't have the volume to make all the chips for Intel even if Intel really decided to switch. Intel will need to invest and wait. It's not like they can just suddenly achieve node parity with AMD, there will be delay and lost market share nonetheless.",0,nan,nan,nan

That's not relatively poor at all.Intel is severely underrated from an investor's point of view. The PE of these two companies couldn't be more different. And if Intel can successfully rebrand the chip war, they won't seem nearly as far behind on tech. The nanometers of a chip really don't matter. It's the transistors that matter, and Intel's 10nm chip has more transistors than AMDs (TSMCs) 7nm chip.Here's a really good article on it by a tech analyst (as opposed to a stock analyst): https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364711-intel-nanometer-games",1,nan,nan,nan
