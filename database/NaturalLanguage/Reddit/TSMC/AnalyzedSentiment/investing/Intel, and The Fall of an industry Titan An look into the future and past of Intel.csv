,"The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel. If you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other’s. https://www.intc.com/investor-relations/investor-education-and-news/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Intel-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results/ https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/","Your DD is fairly inaccurate in many ways and seems to based on second hand information gathered from internet articles rather then first hand knowledge of their products.For example:While yes intel did get stagnant with consumer product developed and has been getting punched in the mouth by AMD in the performance per dollar category ever since AMD launched the Ryzen series back in 2017.Saying that AMD is better in every category besides gaming because of faster core speeds, especially when it comes to industry is just completely inaccurate. First off AMD has significant cooling issues compared to intel chips currently; with most AMD machines doubling as a space heater for your office in the winter. This hurts both performance and longevity of the hardware and is a huge consideration in industry. You also talk about how many games are optimized for intel but fail to talk about how a lot of software used in industry is also optimized for intel. Additionally in an attempt to make their product as versatile as possible AMD leaves it up to the chip set manufactures to implement features into the board instead of integrating them straight into the CPU. For example, now that TB3 is open for everyone to use if you want to be able to utilize it on an AMD machine you need to purchase a board with it integrated into the board since the CPU doesn’t have lanes dedicated directly to it. On the other hand intel chips have dedicated lanes for it meaning your going to get faster performance using intel vs AMD when doing anything with TB3. Basically when it comes to comparing actual real world performance it becomes extremely dependent on the specific work load your using it for and the environment. It’s not nearly as neat and pretty as the synthetic benchmarks make it out to be.Another big thing I think you fail to take into account is that AMD beating out intel for certain periods of time is not uncommon. Back in 2000 AMD was the first CPU manufacture to hit 1GHz and only a few years after that AMD beat intel into incorporating memory controllers into their CPUs. If you were around in the early 2000’s you would probably being saying exactly what your saying now about intel and you would have been completely wrong. Basically what I’m saying is AMD and intel having been competing with each other for something like 30 years now and predicting that either one of them will fall because the other leaped frogged the other is pretty dumb.You also say things like “AMD is doubling their cores every two years”. This is just plain false, yes AMD had a giant leap forward, but if you look at a complete sample size, say the last 10 years, AMD has not been doubling core count every 2 years. They had a big leap forward which is the exception not the rule.Another thing you mention is security but then you even say yourself that AMD has only slowly been gaining market share on intel. Which means we most likely have a slew of AMD vulnerabilities coming at us over the next few years as the hardware gets more widely utilized and people begin to target it more.I love AMD, my personal machine is a Ryzen machine. I think Ryzen is amazing and I think AMD did an awesome job developing this product and disrupting the market . But without knowing what the next 5 years will bring us in tech. You can’t sit there with any type of authority claiming the door is shutting on intel. Especially when you know the history of how these companies tend trade back and forth with each other.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years.

That being said you seem to be a victim of the dunning-kruger effect. Just because AMDs current product line up is outperforming intels in many areas doesn’t mean that they are just barely surviving. Again AMD and Intel have a history of going back and fourth so this isn’t some type of crazy never heard of event. If you actually knew the history’s of these two companies you wouldn’t be drawing the conclusions that your drawing. Additionally although CPUs are are the core of Intels business. Intel has invested greatly in a multitude of areas and has a ton of valuable IP. So the fact that your sitting here saying that Intel doesn’t have any IP advantage speaks to your lack of knowledge about the company.At the end of the day the only thing AMD stepping means is that the consumers are gonna get a ton of bang for their buck over the next couple of years. Intel is going to be pushing hard to regain there position in the consumer market and AMD is going to be fighting hard to keep and continue to take more of Intels market share. This means both companies are going to be pushing hard to develop higher performance products while competing which each other in price.

There have been several instances since the early 90’s where intel has not had a manufacturing lead.-AMD was the first manufacturer to hit 1 GHz-AMD was the first to incorporate memory controllers into the CPU-AMD was the first to put two cores on a single die-AMD was the first to bring about the APU which brought integrated graphics to an entirely new level-AMD beat intel to the 5GHz mark-And lately and most notably AMD has gotten down to the 7nm mark when intel probably won’t reach it until 2021.This narrative you guys are preaching that AMD leap frogging ahead of intel means the death of an industry titan is just mind boggling. AMD and intel having literally been going back and fourth like this since the early 90’s. There is no new event happening here. You guys seem to be on the upward ark of the dunning-Kruger effect. There seems to be so much you don’t know about this subject that you don’t even know what you don’t know.,6,nan,nan,nan
,"The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years.

,"The decline Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space. The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have nothing. A story of stagnation Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel. Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years.

Meeting competition https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&biw=1920&bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question) We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat. Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details. *MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.” The future Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”. These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel. If you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other’s. https://www.intc.com/investor-relations/investor-education-and-news/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Intel-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results/ https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/","Please read it it talks about their product stack, and they have not talked at all about solid, real products for Autonomous driving that I am aware of. Plus most manufacturers chose to design their ASIC’s in house to suit their needs.",1,nan,nan,nan
