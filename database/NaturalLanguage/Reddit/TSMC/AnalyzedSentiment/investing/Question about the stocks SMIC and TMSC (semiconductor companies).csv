,The Chinese semiconductor company SMIC was hit by sanctions preventing trading to the US on September 2020 yet it's shares didn't change much in price from September 2020 onwards. I read they supplied 80% of Qualcomm which is a massive customer so the sanction should have had a massive hit to their demand. Compared to Taiwanese company TSMC which faced a surge in demand from the ban and has a noticeable increase in stock price from September 2020 onwards. What is the reason for this behaviour? Why does the stock SMIC not drop in value when it loses a lot of demand? Is it simply because people aren't selling their shares and are holding out?,"Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Where there has been an increase in demand from factories. So it's business as usual. But inability to get new equipment is hampering future growth and profitability. Thus the price remained more or less the same, with possiblity of dropping in the future if the ban on equipment continues.Tsmc on the other hand is mass manufacturing 5nm chips and already in testing phrase for 3nm chips. Only Samsung and tsmc are able to mass produce 5nm chips currently, and it's the highest margin product they have now. So market is pricing in future profit and growth. Which makes price rise.I will put my money in tsmc for now unless I am certain smic is getting the ban lifted.",0,nan,nan,nan

No other company can beat it and China will not be able to become self-sufficient in semiconductor because to produce semiconductor you need euv machines produced by ASML its a dutch company that decided to not give their machines to China for politican reasons.IMO if you want to own the semiconductor market (the new gold) buy TSMC and ASML.,0,nan,nan,nan

It’s compounded by the fact that these markets don’t see lot of whistleblowing and activist investor kind of activity as maybe possible states side.I remember muddy waters research was one such actor for Chinese stocks listed on NaSDaQ.

If the demand is I elastic then they can just sell their semiconductors elsewhere with minimal impact. Same if the worldwide supply is inelastic.,0,nan,nan,nan

SMIC success I reckon would hinge more on its ability to poach talents from TMSC than raising capital. For this reason the TMSC/Samsung nodes will stay ahead unless process innovation slows down and the market becomes commoditised, giving SMIC time to catch up.I read somewhere the regulators in TW are doing something to address this but I have my doubt about the effectiveness.I would stick with TMSC, SMIC to me is like buying dogecoin, ofcourse your mileage may vary.
