,"Specifically for the semiconductor industry, if you follow the market players there, there are a few like nVidia, TSMC and Broadcom that seem like they will be good investments for the next few years because of their stance in the industry. Any thoughts on buying a few individual stocks of an ETF like SMH vs just buying SMH instead? I'm guessing if you think the top few stocks will perform well on their own, you would be better off there. If you want more diversity and a more safe market wave ride, then ETF. Anything else to consider?","If you consider an ETF, you should also consider capped or uncapped.",0,nan,nan,nan
