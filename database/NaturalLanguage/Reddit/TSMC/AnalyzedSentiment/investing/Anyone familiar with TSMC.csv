,I recently bought 24 OTM option leaps on TSMC because It has very low implied volatility compared to everything else has only decreased 13% this year. Will the coronavirus catch up to this company and cause it to drop more like everything else? Would it be better to invest in a company that has been more damaged by the coronavirus? Any thoughts or recommendations would be much appreciated.,"Yes. A lot. They're one of my customers.I guess I don't understand why you're investing in a single stock that you know nothing about, but only prior trend lines.How do you think semiconductor processing will do this year? Who are their major competitors and why aren't you investing in them, instead? Who are TSMC's customers and how are they impacted?",0,nan,nan,nan

I know they make chipsets for smartphones / computers and are a part of the 5g movement which was seeing substantial growth before the coronavirus.I think all their customers will be impacted differently to an extent that is not fully understood yet, but they have a diverse customer base across the globe that should allow them to continually sell the chips that they make. Even in a virus we still need computers and phones so after the initial fear wears off I believe computer and phone sales should ramp back fairly quickly.I think they have a pretty dominant position in this market, but am not exactly sure who their competitors are. Honestly the semiconductor industry confuses me because It’s hard to know which companies are in the beginning of the assembly line competing against TSMC and which ones partners buying the TSMC chipsets to assemble a larger device.I need to spend more time reading but I thought I’d come steal knowledge from reddit first to get a general idea as to even what I need to be researching.",1,nan,nan,nan

According to all our forecasting consultants and publications, semi was supposed to rebound this year, as they've been down for over a year, now. Who knows if that's delayed with covid-19.It's a good segment in which to put your money if you're willing to keep it a couple years or more. If you're just looking to play the current volatility, I wouldn't do it in semi.",0,nan,nan,nan

Oh wait, you already purchased leaps for this stock without knowing if they would be effected more or less than other semi companies. So you already made a high risk, high reward bet on this, and now you want to know what the future will be. So what happens if Huawei gets banned from multiple markets, and Qualcomm chooses another supplier? Could happen, or companies could choose to keep using tsmc. Nobody knows.But you already out money down on their future. Good luck.",0,nan,nan,nan
