,"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN14P2N1?il=0 This is breaking news. Profits up 50%. KRW 9.2 trillion or USD $7.8 billion in profit. That is unprecedented given the fact that the Galaxy Note 7 fallout was probably going to have a gigantic impact on Q4 numbers. I am guessing that DRAM prices were manipulated, allowing Samsung to offset any damages from the Galaxy Note 7 scandal. I'm not sure whether this is good news for other semiconductor manufacturers like Micron. Micron is a tiny player compared to Samsung, and Samsung's market share still trounces that of Micron. Micron may indirectly continue to benefit from rising DRAM prices, however there are many more risks for Micron ahead. I wish I could invest in Samsung, but since I am not based in Korea, I don't think I can. (Please let me know how I can.. I think I need a Korean permanent residency visa or something). I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung becomes more profitable than Apple in 2017. Apple just cut iPhone 7 production by 10% for the first quarter of 2017. We will see soon.",A 50% YoY increase is very shocking.How did they manage that even with the Note 7 explosion scandal?,0,nan,nan,nan
