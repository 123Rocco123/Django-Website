,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes üí°Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. üí°CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. üí°US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. üí°First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don‚Äôt see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. üí°Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity üí°International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks üí°Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven‚Äôt felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022‚Äôs large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. üí°Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.","What did they predict for 2023, 2022, etc?Nobody knows nothing.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes üí°Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. üí°CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. üí°US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. üí°First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don‚Äôt see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. üí°Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity üí°International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks üí°Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven‚Äôt felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022‚Äôs large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. üí°Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",Yes agreed. I think they are good data points but not something you should lean on.

,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes üí°Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. üí°CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. üí°US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. üí°First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don‚Äôt see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. üí°Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity üí°International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks üí°Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven‚Äôt felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022‚Äôs large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. üí°Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024.

Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks.

,"LINKS to outlooks: BlackRock JP Morgan Citi Mastercard Charles Schwab I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes. Themes üí°Inflation and interest rates will fall The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates. Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year. üí°CapEx returns Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending. With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back. More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices. üí°US election year Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election. Less policy volatility is good for markets. Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though. üí°First half angst, second half gains Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don‚Äôt see a recession happening. BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù fashion. Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end. üí°Everyone is bullish on AI The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC). In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments: Mag 7 (mega cap tech) Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) Robotics Drug discovery Cybersecurity üí°International: Japan, China, and India For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe. The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks. Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance: Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets. Risks üí°Economic risks Interest rates and inflation are top of mind. The general worry is that we haven‚Äôt felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022‚Äôs large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. üí°Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks.

AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment. üí°Geopolitical Risks Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks. My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down. The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now. Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before. Summary With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic: 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 2024-2025: normalization to growth We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.","I wonder what the market does for returns the next 1-3 years. Or even longer but that's even more of a blind ass guess. Are we just headed back to 10-30% returns almost every year? If that sounds wild, look at the historical annual performance of the SP500 before you shit on me.",0,nan,nan,nan
