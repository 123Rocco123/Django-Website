,"Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)","I might, but I don't have enough cash to buy 60 million shares at the moment.And it might not be such a wise investment. If the Chinese overlords decide to take over Taiwan, Buffet's shares in TSMC go bye-bye.Why not invest in a U.S. located I.C. foundry?",0,nan,nan,nan

Additionally its building a huge factory in Arizona to benefit from the CHiPs Act.On top of that, just like with OXY, simply because Buffet is involved in something, that drives buying action to TSM.It's definitely not too late since semis have a long way to go back up, and TSM's price could increase 50% and still a PE in the teens.Bottom line, buying some TSM shares is low risk and has much higher upside potential.",0,nan,nan,nan

,"Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA. Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean? Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Should you invest in TSMC? My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.
