I thought ETF's are just a bundle of stocks you can invest in that mimic the s&p500. And I thought the stock trading apps (fidelity, etc) are where the extra fees come in.

They take a proportion of the earnings every year to manage. Passive funds like VOO have super low expense ratios. I’m sure dumb shit like ARKK has high ones and crashes.

The problem is that they cannot sustain that growth indefinitely. When their growth slows their stocks will fall.Now all of those companies are doing great and likely have a long runway before that happens. However to succeed at investing in them you need to understand how to recognize when this change is happening.The reason folks say you will loose money is your post makes you sound like someone who knows very little about investing. That means you're not likely to recognize the change I described above, and very likely to panic sell at a small downturn. Both of which make you more likely to loose money than make it.Someone who doesnt know anything about investing shouldn't be stock picking. I'm not trying to insult you, there is nothing wrong with not being an investing expert. Go to r/bogleheads and follow their instructions for investing in diversified index funds.

I don't believe we will go back to a time when computer chips weren't in everything g, but if there is a downturn, all those stocks could go down at the same time. And if you need that money at a specific time, and it coincides with a downturn then you are forced to sell at a less than optimal time.Investment basics haven't really changed. If you put all your money in NVidia when it was at its 52 week low of $223/ share in Mar 2023 and sold it Mar 8, 2024 (last week) at $974/ share your money would have more than tripled!But let's say you put all your money in Google on Sept 18, 2023 at $138/share and sold it on Mar 8, at $136/ share you would have lost money.Of course, I picked those dates on purpose to illustrate the point.Invest as much as possible every month. Put retirement money (at your age) into high reward investments, which are also high risk. Some months you will buy at a high price, sometimes a low but it will average out. And in 30-40 years you will have seen significant growth.Unless you have the time and interest in investigating individual companies and enough money to buy into enough different companies, buy an ETF or mutual fund with low fees that represents the things you are interested in, like tech stocks.Invest money you need sooner into a mix of business sectors and investment categories (bonds and cash ex) that is safer. You still want to make money but you want the money available for the bat mitzvah when your (imaginary) daughter is 13, and not have to postpone until your investments rebound.Dollar cost averaging Diversification Asset Allocation",0,nan,nan,nan

He’s holding for several years, not a few days. Those are well established companies, not speculative penny stocks.I think you’re misunderstanding my point. I’m not saying there is anything wrong with the strategy of buying individual stocks. There isn’t anything wrong with it!What I am saying is that it’s a terrible suggestion for someone who has no idea what they are doing.I’m also saying that buying (and holding) individual stocks is taking on more risk than just buying index funds. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, you need to take on risk to take rewards. All of us are taking on some risk by investing in the market in the first place, right? But people on this thread seem to be deluding themselves into thinking that they somehow have the same risk as an index investor. That’s absolutely absurd.When you buy Google or Apple as individual stock, you aren’t just betting that these companies will continue to do well. You’re betting that these stocks will continue to do better than the market expects. I also own Apple and Google at their appropriate market weight via my index funds.Calculated risk can be a good thing tho! I tilt my own portfolio towards small cap value stocks (via index funds) for exactly that reason.But taking risks when you think you aren’t is just dumb.Also, selling a stock doesn’t mean you think it’s about o go down. Most of the time it means that you needed to liquidate for some cash, or you found a better investment.People who are selling stocks in order to get cash to live on aren’t impacting the price of shares. People who are selling stocks because of better investment opportunities is exactly what I’m talking about though - they think the stock will do worse than expected and thus are jumping ship to something else.",2,nan,nan,nan

Active stock managers underperform the market very, very often. Here are some possible conclusions from that, and I'm wondering which you believe is true.Beating the market is relatively easy if you're willing to do a little work, but Wall Street is filled with tons of high-paid professional money managers who for some reason aren't putting in that work or doing dumb strategies.It's actually quite hard - you're just a rare genius who can actually do it, and you should really be on Wall Street getting paid millions of dollars.You got lucky - probably by hitting on a few individual stocks with a very high return - and are suffering from survivorship bias.There is a vast amount of history and data that points to #3.

And does it generate more returns adjusted for that risk than just buying the whole market/sector through an ETF? You may be getting marginally better returns but with a lot more risk, so not apples to apples to compare it with market returnsYes it is true that people should do their homework before investing, but if you're spending time (over coffee like you, for instance) and end up with a diversified portfolio (of 30 stocks like you) that may be very close to the market/sector composition, was it worth it? Or did you just spend time picking stocks when you could get to the same/similar (risk adjusted) return with less effort through a low-expense ETF?",2,nan,nan,nan

There’s plenty of reason to believe in those companies.What is considerably less reasonable is sinking all of your investments into those companies. That’s a way bigger bet. If you had a solid diversified portfolio already, it would be totally reasonable to buy up those positions until they reached maybe 5-10% of your portfolio, or possibly even more. But if we’re talking about everything you have in the market, then you’re really just gambling.So IMO, consider just buying a total market or S&P 500 fund, and devote maybe 10-15% of your total to a fund that invests in these companies instead.",0,nan,nan,nan

I'm in my late 30's, and am OK with moderate to a good deal of risk. Thank you","Thank you so much for taking the time. Maybe it's because I'm looking at too short a time frame, but from my research it looked like all the companies over the years that I heard were going to perform extremely well in stocks beat the S&P 500 in a 15 year span. From Jan 2006 until Dec 2021 was what I looked at.Amazon (AMZN): Jan 2009 to Dec 2021, over 15,000% increase.Facebook (FB): IPO to Dec 2021, over 1,100% increase.Google (GOOG/GOOGL): Jan 2006 to Dec 2021, over 1,200% increase.Starbucks (SBUX): Jan 2006 to Dec 2021, over 600% increase.Microsoft (MSFT): Jan 2006 to Dec 2021, over 1,500% increase.S&P 500: Jan 2006 to Dec 2021, roughly over 200% increase.But, is the heart of the logic toward the S&P500 that most individual companies will end up stagnating, losing a lot of value, etc, while we know the S&P500 will consistently go up. Therefore, one may do better with those above if they know when to pull out?Thanks again!",0,nan,nan,nan

Is VGT an index fund where they choose a bundle of AI related stocks and you buy the bundle?Like for example,(Hypothetical)VGT has 2 stocks of MSFT, 4 stocks of Nvidia, 10 stocks of ARM, 5 stocks of TSMC.Then you buy 3 stocks of VGT and so you have the equivalent of 6 stocks of MSFT, 12 stocks of Nvidia, 30 stocks of ARM, and 15 stocks of TSMC.Thank you!",1,nan,nan,nan

But don't think of it in terms of owning X number of shares of a company, more dollar amounts. https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgt#portfolio-compositionTop holdings are: MSFT - 20.51% AAPL - 20.19% NVDA - 5.12%So if you buy $1000 worth of VGT, 20.51% (or about $205) will be invested in MSFT stock, 20.19% into AAPL, 5.12% into NVDA, etc, etc.Those weights change with the performance of the companies and their market cap. Come April, NVDA will most likely also be 15-20% of VGT since it's market cap has exploded recently.That's the beauty of index funds, your money (and performance) will change as the market changes. Better companies will do better and become a larger part of the index and crappy companies will fall off.",2,nan,nan,nan
