,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes. At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too! Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM. If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too. What do you think?",Speaking as someone who works in semiconductors... Apple can't buy TSMC. The Taiwanese government wouldn't allow it. Imagine Samsung buying Intel or something - the US government would kill that deal immediately. Letting a foreign company control your most advanced chipmaker is a national security risk.,0,nan,nan,nan
