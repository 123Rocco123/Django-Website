Aditionally, ASML’s revenue in the future will no longer be as dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). What are your thoughts on this?","I own it and added to my position last Friday. I own a number of semiconductor stocks (NVDA, ASML, AMAT, TSMC, AVGO) and am holding for the long term. I was glad to see AVGO pop on Friday and it’s up nearly 10% today.",0,0.536,POSITIVE,0.996

Click on 5 years chart and notice something: ASML is a cyclical stock. It corresponds to Semiconductor producers buying many machines and then them not doing so. Of course previous data doesn't translate to future results.,0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.691

Invest in things you know and can understand. The more niche and specialized it is, the more you should make sure you understand it.ASML makes lithography machines used by foundry companies like Samsung and TSMC to produce the chips for, well, just about everyone.ASML is supposed to have a monopoly in this. But it is also a cyclical industry. And if you don't know when the cycle starts or ends, you may overpay for a strong business.Yes, it is possible to overpay for a strong business which will hurt your returns even if the business does well in the long-term.So if you want to get into this, I'd suggest making sure you understand how the industry works, and where in the cycle it currently is.",0,0.543,POSITIVE,0.82

And chances are, you will miss out on investments that did well. But that's okay. Just learn, and move on.Stick with your circle of competence, and stay way from industries you don't understand or don't like.

What are your thoughts on this?","If memory serves, they specifically mentioned the cyclical nature of their business and a downturn through 2025 in their 20-F.Other random thoughts:TSMC is upgrading to ASML’s newest lithography machines and aiming for mass production in 2030.I want to punish myself with eating a lightbulb for saying this… but AI.Additionally, I’d guess there’s going to be an AI-related dump in the next two to three years. Investors poured $7T into AI and will want to see returns… or else. Obviously, things never are that give-and-take. The stock market isn’t a pez dispenser. BUT things will rebound and reach all-highs, yada yada.INTL is a dumpster fire right now, but they’ll turn around at some point. That turnaround is predicated on ASML’s machines.ASML’s moat.And other things like developing countries/populations and their needs for computing.So, yes, undervalued IMHO.ETA: Had to look up my average cost: $81.

But if you also look historically when the equipment spending accelerates again - asml jumps enormously.

ASML is impacted by this even though they are a Dutch company (and the scope expansion of the foreign direct product rule surely isn't going to help.) Additionally, the US is pressuring the Netherlands to follow them on their chip controls.

A quote from his article TSMC Earnings, Margins and Arizona, ASML and Peak Lithography:That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.From Doug O’Laughlin at Fabricated Knowledge:Another way to interrupt this statement is that EUV intensity is peaked if they think the DUV attach rate is growing as fast as EUV. This has been a long time coming, and Applied Materials puts it well in this slide – 3nm is the apex of lithography market share gains. This is not good for ASML and the EUV story....The last decade has been the decade of Lithography, and I can almost assure you that Lithography spending will grow slower in the next decade than WFE [Wafer Fab Equipment]. And let’s not forget that in the decade before EUV, lithography was only 15-20% of the expenditure. I believe that lithography will revert to the mid-20s of WFE.I think it’s time for investors to accept the decade of lithography is over. The premium ASML has slowly gained for itself for the last decade should end as the decade of litho ends. And the recent price move has been a collapse of that premium. I believe it should trade in line with other semi-cap companies, as I’m sure that Litho will not outgrow WFE but will be valued for its strong monopoly.It'll still continue to be a good business, but not a great one that is likely to produce outsized returns.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.992
