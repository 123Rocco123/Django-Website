,"As it turns out, not all new iPhones are created equal. There’s two different versions of the A9 processor, and while they’re mostly the same, one of the chips seems to be killing battery life. shortly after the phone’s launch, there are two different A9 chips: one made by Samsung on a 14nm process, and one (slightly bigger) by TSMC. Apple sourced the chips from two manufacturers in an attempt to reduce the supply problems that are normally a hallmark of iPhone launches. But the two chips don’t work exactly the same. Although they benchmark with about the same power, the battery life (and excess heat) is different. According to posts on forums and some Chinese sites, phones with the TSMC processor get two hours more battery life on the Geekbench battery test, while running a few degrees cooler. Looks like a scandal.","If you're comparing this to the VW scandal, I don't think it's a good comparison. In VW's case a large part of diesel's appeal was that it was more efficient and more environmentally friendly. Hence when it wasn't it violated the consumer's trust. Apple doesn't sell its iPhone as the best performing phone and doesn't even make any performance guarantees.Honestly this whole thing is much ado about nothing.",0,nan,nan,nan
