Apple and Samsung combined account for 39% of the smartphone volumes and 95% of the total smartphone market revenues. TSMC (TSM) expects 8% smartphone growth, while Qualcomm expects 10% growth in 3G/4G devices (which is a category more expansive than just the smartphone market, as it includes other connected devices). Xiaomi’s shipments of around 70.8mn were up ~25% yoy; however the company missed its target of 80-100mn smartphones for the year. DigiTimes reported that Xiaomi’s shipments won’t grow much this year, as the company plans to focus on costs and improving the software in its smartphones, rather than market share. Xiaomi is about 5% of the market, according to Gartner.""","Things have evolved from a focus on hardware to a focus on software/data/the experience/etc. Facebook and Google doing exceptionally well. Apple is a good value at this point, but all things considered, unless they either go and buy someone or surprise people with the next great thing, Apple is not going to deliver the kind of growth that people have come to expect from it. I think people have to move away from the focus on software and focus on every other aspect of online: shopping, (as much as it annoys me) social, financial (mobile payments, online banking), etc. Data center REITs up or not down much on a day where the market was nearly -300 at one point.TLDR: I think going forward a core theme is what are people doing online (whether it be search or shopping or whatever) and what's the infrastructure required to deliver an increasing amount of demand for data.",0,nan,nan,nan

Specially those data centers outside major metropolitan areas with decent marketshare. Same with mobile payments and mobile payments.I agree with you regarding Apple, but I think the lack of hardware growth could be offset to a degree with the supplemental services that it offers. And I think you are right, they are going to have to use that cash in adquisitions.",1,nan,nan,nan

However, I'd be willing to say that there's likely a large swath of the retail investing populace that still acts like this is the Steve Jobs era and is growing frustrated with their expectations of (until yesterday) the largest company on the planet - expectations that are clearly not being met and no longer realistic. Every year that they don't pull another iPhone-sized rabbit out of their hat, it will become more obvious to anyone who is holding out hope that Apple will deliver another ""iphone-sized"" next big thing.",2,nan,nan,nan
