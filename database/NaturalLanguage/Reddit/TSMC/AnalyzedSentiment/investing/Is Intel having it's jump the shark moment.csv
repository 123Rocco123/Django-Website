,"The latest Intel marketing for their CPUs is pretty bad. This video is a pretty geeky presentation on it, but it gets the point across. https://youtu.be/xUT4d5IVY0A?si=mExsXL-IUOgag3ZZ This marketing taken on it's own, is no big deal, but when you look at it in the context of how much Intels market share has declined, and how they are starting to pay TSMC to make their products. This is starting to look like things are getting pretty weak in Intel land. What do you nice folks think the impacts of these factors is going to be on stock price? I think INTC is going to flatten out growth, maybe start to slide if these management issues keep happening.",This guys video is almost as awkward as the subject. Why is he walking down an alley towards a camera 50 feet away from him while seemingly talking to the camera. Why’s he popping out from behind a tree? Why’s he driving a car while talking? Am I missing some subtext or spoof or self deprecation joke here?,0,nan,nan,nan

Intel needs massive capital investment and R&D ( massive = on a scale rarely seen in other industries) to compete with TSMC at a time when their revenues are collapsing.

There is no way that Intel, or anyone else for that matter, can catch up to TSMC. TSMC has built a machine for bringing newer, better processes to the market. Because they will almost always have the newest and most efficient processes, they attract lots of customers. They then circulate those learnings to the other members of the ""process machine"" team, and then they invest tons of Apples money and Googles Money etc. into making the next set of processes better.The TSMC process for bringing up new processes is the business equivalent of the machine gun, while the other foundries, including Intel, are still using single shot rifles. Intel used to do this, and then lost their way. TSMC one upped them. Now Intel needs to try to rebuild their process while trying to catch up to TSMC, and they just cannot have the resources to do that, at least while paying a dividend and bonuses to their employees.This is the advantage that AMD has over Intel, and why Intel is going to keep falling further and further behind. AMD is benefitting from portions of the investments that Apple, Qualcomm, and a host of other companies, are making into their chips. Intel can invest tons of money, but they can't invest more than all these other companies combined.",1,nan,nan,nan
