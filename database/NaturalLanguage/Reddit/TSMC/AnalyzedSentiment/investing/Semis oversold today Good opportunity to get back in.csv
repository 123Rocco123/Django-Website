,Buying SOXL today (3x leveraged semi). Anybody else doing the same? I think it’s very likely to pop back up after today’s oversell due to the iphone sales weaking report from tsmc,"I think it’s very likely to pop back up after today’s oversell due to the iphone sales weaking report from tsmcThis is a long-term fundamental signal. I would be careful here. Negative or lower-trending forward guidance is not kind to cyclical stocks that have seen huge runs in recent quarters. Tread carefully here and don't expect long term rips like saw in 2017 from semiconductors.From a short-term trading perspective, the charts look pretty ugly for semiconductors. Close to the neckline of a head and shoulders with it just breaking below a multi-year channel. It could very well pop back up, but I wouldn't make a bet on that occurring right now.",0,nan,nan,nan

No way, that never happens!Find me a time where a CEO is outright negative about their company's outlook, especially on national TV. This is pretty useless. And regardless, what does it matter the reason for weak iphone guidance? Fewer iphones sold = lower chip sales. The reasoning is irrelevant here. If there is lower demand and lower sales, it will affect chipmakers regardless.",1,nan,nan,nan
