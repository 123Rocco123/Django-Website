,I am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding NVDA specifically those who call the company a result of an AI bubble and compare it to those the Dot.com bubble. I feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those Dot.com bubble companies never had real earnings. They essentially got to the point where they just added dot.com to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.,"The comparison comes to Cisco, which made routers and switches. Cisco made tons of money. But when the the dot com bubble burst Cisco's stock collapsed and hasn't beaten it's all time high that it had in like 2000.   Nvidia the fear is much the same, the customers won't be making money, or having long term success, so the growth and sales will collapse.   For reference, Wall Street HATES Cisco. They make about as much revenue as Nvidia, and have 1/16 the market cap. Cisco, does not have impressive growth. But Cisco still makes as much money as Nvidia. EDIT: FY2023 Cisco made as much revenue as Nvidia. And a year ago Cisco had 1/10 the market cap. This year Nvidia made twice as much as Cisco   What's going to happen when the Nvidia growth machine stalls? Think they'll still be loved enough to have 16x the market cap of a company that makes as much money as them?",0,nan,nan,nan

CSCO made $2B last Q, NVDA made $16B.> What's going to happen when the Nvidia growth machine stalls?When will that be? They are sold out for 2025. Their largest competitor, AMD sees the AI TAM at $500B by 2028. And Sam Altman thinks he needs $7T to discover AGI. So just when exactly are you projecting the growth to stall?> Think they'll still be loved enough to have 16x the market cap of a company that makes as much money as them?Well, Cisco doesn't if you want to check the numbers yourself. But with the greenfield for growth and competitive advantage Nvidia has going, the likelihood is they will continue to command a premium in their share multiple is high.",1,nan,nan,nan

Nvidia doubled revenue over a year. My comparison is for sure out of date. I think for FY2023 the revenue thing was true. My bad there.When will the growth stall? Idk. That's why they say don't time the market. You can say all you want about company projections, but when LLMs turn out to not be profitable for every company, and only profitable for a handful, expect the growth to stall.",2,nan,nan,nan

Nvidia grew revenue at 21% CAGR from 2012-2022:2022. $26,9142012. $3,998> when LLMs turn out to not be profitableI love it when folks think they know everything about a company and then prove they don't with one silly little statement.The hint here is that LLMs are not the market. Generative AI is so much more than LLMs. It's medical research, and physics and chemistry.

They need to communicate with their colleagues in Switzerland, China, and Australia. Cisco is the picks and shovels for that and a whole lot more.Do you at least get the concern and comparison?

CSCO is a better investment. Got it. Why are you posting in a thread about Nvidia if that's how you feel?CISCO's competitors are: Juniper, Broadcom, Arista, PaloAlto, Extreme, Huawai and others. My view is what they are doing is offering a commodity product, but okay. They may be a picks and shovels supplier but there are a whole lot of others selling picks and shovels along side them, right?Cisco may be a fine company with a fine outlook, and all that is well and good, but they aren't at the same growth or profitability or opportunity or competitively superior position Nvidia is in are they?So no, I really don't get the concern/comparison. I think folks who make that sort of comparison are not well-informed about NVDA.Nvidia will do more than $200B+ in sales next year and will be the largest MC company the world has ever seen. There is a reason for that. Nvda is like cisco 1992, but lots of folks are trying to tell us it's late Feb 2000. It's not.",5,nan,nan,nan

But in the end it's not realistic to choose Linux (ROCm) at the enterprise level, and I say that from the perspective of someone that uses Linux on the desktop daily.Or as another example, CUDA is closed source while ROCm is open source. And the reason why ROCm is open source is (arguably) because AMD is trying to gain market share.Here's a recent thread on selecting a vendor for AI purposes.

Those describing as such either don't understand the company or are working against it. Their technology effectively was the first broadly available that allowed the vast gobs of computation required for AI modeling to happen. They build a platform for others to build upon.This is quite different from what Cisco was building in the late 1990s, they were more like the first to market with a standard technology when later lots of others came in and torpedoed their market.Nvidia's platform is being adopted by most major companies all over the world (not just tech companies, but Coke, BMW, Amazon, Pfizer, Seimens, John Deer, JPMorgan etc). That tells you its not a bubble. Their platform has 90% market share for a reason, it's solid and it works. Competitors have been claiming Nvidia is vulnerable since 2015, yet here they sit with nearly all the market share. Dozens of startups have come and gone and major tech companies like AMD, Intel and Google aren't moving the needle against them.Nvidia has years of growth ahead.disclosure: long, concentrated",0,nan,nan,nan
