,"Hi all, Thank you for taking the time to look over this and give your opinion on the subject matter. I was building my portfolio and trying to decide between a more heavy ""growth"" TSMC VS a ""value"" Intel. I'm bullish on the whole semiconductor industry but get is to splitting hairs between the two largest chipmakers. This choice was simpler before Intels new CEO brought back a renewed vigor in manufacturing and Development, Looking at the balance sheets and market parameters.

Thanks for your time Mods delete if not permitted","Intel along with nvidia and amd are moving into pure chip design space, outsourcing actual manufacturing to TSMC. Intel was the only big chipmaker that actually manufactured those chips in house but they have fallen far behind TSMC manufacturing capabilities so they are also going after a pure design/fabless model slowly. Anyway I see, TSMC stands to gain. How much of that is already priced in I don’t know, because it already has a half a trillion market cap.In short, TSMC will do great in the future but I don’t know how much room the stock still has left to grow. Intel is at a crossroads, if they come out with a great launch in the next couple years they’d be back with a bang but it’s slightly speculative. They haven’t done a great launch in half a decade now",0,nan,nan,nan

Thanks for your time Mods delete if not permitted","Intel is a big ship. They are hard to sink but they don't make turns easily.Bob Swan was an absolute business/finance clown who got into his role by corporate rat racing and office politicking rather than engineering, production, or actual results. So when he's at the helm Intel focused on stupid shit like ""talking about potential deals"", ""looking for potential merge candidates"", ""share buybacks"", corporate goon speak like ""Our tigerlake CPUs are actually better for AI!"", and cherry picked results. He's so fucking bad INTC rallied 10% the day he was removed as CEO.From within the company, INTC keeps shitting the bed on the 7nm. That's all it would have taken to solve their price issues and they'd be well over $70 if they could regardless of the manufacturing being done in house or outsourced to TSMC. 99% of the consumers don't really give a shit and many wouldn't even know to care. THe US gov might care, but if really they cared so much about it as a national security issue then they'd stick with the current chipset, wait for the 3/5nm, and actively invest to have then made in the US. It's not like they have another choice (atm).To make matters worse, they are being bombarded by all sides. TSMC dominating in manufacturing, Nvdia/ARM/AMD/Samsung literally eating their lunch with 7nm and working on 3/5nms, Apple jumping ship and firing at INTC with their own chips, MSFT getting into chips too, and every mofo wanting to get into the chip space.Bob Swan getting removed is a right step, but INTC really needs to take the humble pill L on the 7nm and step it up by refocusing on the next gen 3/5nm chips. 7nm at this point shouldn't be a goal they work towards much as a chore that needs to get done like going to the restroom after shitting your pants because they've shit their pants for 4-8 quarters already. They literally should just buy a TSMC/AMD/NV 7nm from Amazon, open it up, and copy it. Because that's how far behind they are. They should literally just give the on their 7nm, just copy someone else's, beg TSMC to make it for them, and then slap their label on it. Then refocus their efforts on the 3/5nm. No fucking point pretending they are going to make some sort of superior 7nm, no point in pretending they have some tech lead, no point in their stupid spin campaigns and cherry picked stats, and no point in pretending they would regain some lost grown if it's it developed & manufactured in house because everyone who knows anything knows they don't lead anymore. Going by their projections and their results so far the rest of the industry will be planning 5nm rollouts by the time they get their 7nm out. They should just take the L and refocus on the next gen rather than putting up airs because they aren't fooling anyone.I would say pick some up if you're willing to hold for a few years while it's competitors run a few laps around INTC. If you're looking for a yolo trade, easy holds, or quick gains then look elsewhere. I'd say buy now or wait until 4/22/2021 when it reports. Very likely they will shit the bed yet again like they did on 2020/Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 and you can get it down huge yet again.",2,nan,nan,nan

Thanks for your time Mods delete if not permitted","This isn't really an apples-to-apples comparison. TSMC's sole principle is on chip manufacturing whereas Intel is currently both chip design and chip manufacturing. Intel has really been struggling in both design and manufacturing for a while now, and there are investors who even suggest that Intel completely drop off it's manufacturing arm and outsource instead like AMD and NVIDIA. Although Intel has lost ground in consumer chips, it's server chips are still king. Simply put, you have to look at Intel holistically. TSMC is a major chipmaker that's received a lot of contracts to produce chips for AMD and NVIDIA, although both AMD and NVIDIA has recently contracted Samsung for making chips.",0,nan,nan,nan

TSMC does manufacturing for the major chipmakers like AMD, Intel, NVDA, and they have the world's largest market share in that space. The second largest is another Taiwanese company called UMC and the third is the Chinese SMIC. I'm bullish on TSMC as they have the dominant position in an industry riding secular trends. Demand for semiconductors is only going up up up. They will also be rolling out 3nm chips by 2022. TSMC's PE ratio is attractive as well for this current market.Biggest risk is geopolitical. What happens to TSMC if US/China get into a hot war? No one knows. But those I talk to in TW are not that worried. They do not think China wants to risk a war.Sources:https://www.notebookcheck.net/TSMC-has-the-largest-market-share-in-the-global-semiconductor-manufacturing-industry-Counterpoints-Research.518137.0.htmlhttps://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-confirms-3nm-tech-for-2022-could-enable-epic-80-billion-transistor-gpus/",0,nan,nan,nan
