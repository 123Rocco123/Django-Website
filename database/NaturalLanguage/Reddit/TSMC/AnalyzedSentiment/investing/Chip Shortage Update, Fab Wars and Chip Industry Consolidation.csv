I'm firmly in the camp that there is a lot of room left to run in this cycle, if it even proves to be a cycle versus a new norm. I base my time left to run off the current demands and what industry experts and businesses are saying about there being chip constraints into 2023 (see recent discussions with Nvidia and Intel) as well as earnings announcements from all chip, fab, and equip. companies noting 20+% growth in the coming year(s). Putting the industry experts aside, I have many friends in compay IT who are building out servers and expanding hardware for more remote/hybrid work. Lastly, is my own personal stance where I am preparing to buy a new phone and PS5, my wife needs a new PC for her consulting, and I'm ordering a new tablet for my daughter - those are all just my purchases happening within the next 2 days to 2 months. To my comment about cyclicality of the industry. I 100% agree that was the case when chips were basically just used in PCs and select high tech hardware - you waited for a new model or new segment that requires chips for there to be a growth cycle. Today it is hard to find anything without chips in it (stoves, cars, watches, new street signs) and their applications just keep growing (AI, 5g, EVs). So will there be ebbs and flows as major new tech hits, sure but I cannot fosee a in the next 5 years when demand drops as some bears are trying portray these days. Like most things only time will tell which way things unfold but to believe we must be ""at the top"" because the last year was really hot is potentially short-sighted to what is right on the horizon.",0,nan,nan,nan

Hard for me to see why chips would be different.Two things would have to be true:Secular (i.e. non COVID-related) mismatch between supply and demand.AND this mismatch wasn't forecasted and accounted for by manufacturers, something they've apparently been doing competently for ~30 years.Not impossible but seems highly improbable to me.

My understanding is that companies can buy production capacity in advance, so if they did that they may be fine. Car companies thought demand for cars would drop during covid so they didn't think to secure themselves a supply of semiconductors. When demand for cars unexpectedly picked up a lot of auto companies couldn't match demand due to not being able to get enough semiconductors due to all semiconductor production being booked for a while.

You also don't have to worry about upgrading your fab equipment or spending money on R&D so you can keep up with competing fabs.

,"The semiconductor industry is adapting to the chip shortage and, business is booming. But the automotive and consumer electronics sectors are having to cut back production at huge costs for some manufacturers. Chip companies are jostling for market share, niches and government benefits.

The article points out that after the chip shortage and pandemic related buying there could be overcapacity as a result of the drive to chip supply independence. And that this could result in increased competitive pressures between manufacturers and countries. Are people trading/investing in the chip shortage? and who do people see as the main winners/losers?
