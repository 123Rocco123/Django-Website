,"After a lot of research on the web and not having found anything, I thought I might ask you guys. I am looking for a website or a tool which can visualize the relationships between each publicly traded company. For example: Apple provides value to x amount of people / Companies --> TSMC provides value to apple by creating the chips --> ASML creates EUV Lithography machines for TSMC to create even smaller chips in future --> etc. Based on that visualization one would be able to see which company provides how much value to other companies and therefore making investing decisions easier for long-term investors.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.
