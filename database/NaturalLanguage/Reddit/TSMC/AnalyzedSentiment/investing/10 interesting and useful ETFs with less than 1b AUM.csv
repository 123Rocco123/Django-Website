,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).

IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf .

NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund .

It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.

What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.

Because of that paying a premium for these funds doesn’t make sense. Please don’t shoot the messenger, I do own actively managed and sector specific funds myself. I’m just explaining why people stay away from high ERs. In the long run when taking into account the added cost of the EP studies show they underperform the market",6,nan,nan,nan

Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think?

It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.

But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.","Expense RATIO. Ration is a typo.It’s an ongoing fee that is charged to the customer by the brokerage.So let’s say you buy $100 of an ETF that has a 1% expense ratio. That means you’re paying $1 per year in expenses to the brokerage.Doesn’t sound like much at small amounts, but when you’re talking retirement savings amounts, it majorly adds up.$100,000 invested at 1% expense ratio is $1,000.$500,000 invested at 1% expense ratio is $5,000.That’s a lot of money being paid out, and frankly it’s not justified for simple passive investing. Knocking that expense ratio down is pure savings. Hence why simple S&P 500 index funds have been competed down to like a 0.03% expense ratio, which is awesome.",2,nan,nan,nan
,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl .

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.

This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

The expense ratio is literally just that, the ratio to fund AUM of the expenses that a fund accrues as a part of its ongoing operations, e.g., fund management, administration, accounting, compliance services, printing costs, insurance, etc (remember, mutual funds are just little companies themselves). Those fees are paid out of the fund’s assets as they are charged by the fund’s various service providers (most service providers charge monthly fees).As others have pointed out, the price and performance of your fund is net of these expenses already.",3,nan,nan,nan
,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.

Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""

It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA .

Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA .

But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.

The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""

Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think?

One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

MJ mostly Canadian players, the cannabis services companies (which are good businesses, but overvalued like GRWG), and some players viewed as part of the ecosystem even though they don't have much exposure today (like tobacco).The US MSOs are the most direct beneficiaries of all the positive trends in the US (both fundamental and regulatory), and most of the good ones have superior growth and margins vs. the Canadian operators and are trading very cheap relative to the CGC/APHA/TLRY's with several catalysts on the horizon. When you look at any of the cannabis ETFs, look for names like AYRWF, TCNNF, GTBIF, CRLBF, CURLF, CCHWF, TRSSF, JUSHF, RWBYF. MSOS is the only one that has them.",2,nan,nan,nan
,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf .

Broad federal legalization (which was proposed in the MORE Act which passed the House in late 2020) would legalize cannabis at a Federal level which would drop barriers on inter-state commerce and allow for a true national industry like in almost every other consumer product. In this world, yes, big tobacco and big alcohol (and maybe others) will be big players. I anticipate they will enter the market via acquisitions. Said differently. If/when we get federal legalization, all of the US MSOs become M&A targets overnight (not a bad outcome as an investor). But...The MORE Act, or a similar version, is highly unlikely to pass in the next few years, and I've heard several cannabis insiders say they don't think it will pass even in 10 years. What is more likely to pass is a version of the STATES Act which decriminalizes cannabis at the federal level and pushes the decision to legalize down to individual states. If you parse the language Schumer has been using, he's been talking a lot about decriminalization vs. broad legalization. In this scenario, I'm not so sure we will see big tobacco or big alcohol make a meaningful push. Rather, I see any participation coming in the form of strategic investments in the winners (AYRWF, GTBIF, TCNNF, CURLF, CRLBF, CCHWF, etc). So...While I think the LT view you articulated on MO makes sense, they are not going to be the most direct beneficiaries over the next few years. The most direct beneficiaries will be the well-capitalized, vertically integrated US MSOs. I think its important to point this out because while cannabis has a long runway for growth (10+ years), we are at a really unique inflection point in the industry's evolution where the MSOs are going to see big gains off of the bottom driving a level of revenue growth and cash generation that will catch a lot of folks and institutions by surprise and should translate to meaningful share price appreciation. I want to be there for that which is why I am bullish the stocks and the MSOS etf",1,nan,nan,nan

Thanks for the awards and comments.","I get where you are coming from but a couple thoughts:The term ""legalization"" is getting used a lot and I think we need to define what that means. Broad federal legalization (which was proposed in the MORE Act which passed the House in late 2020) would legalize cannabis at a Federal level which would drop barriers on inter-state commerce and allow for a true national industry like in almost every other consumer product. In this world, yes, big tobacco and big alcohol (and maybe others) will be big players. I anticipate they will enter the market via acquisitions. Said differently. If/when we get federal legalization, all of the US MSOs become M&A targets overnight (not a bad outcome as an investor). But...The MORE Act, or a similar version, is highly unlikely to pass in the next few years, and I've heard several cannabis insiders say they don't think it will pass even in 10 years. What is more likely to pass is a version of the STATES Act which decriminalizes cannabis at the federal level and pushes the decision to legalize down to individual states. If you parse the language Schumer has been using, he's been talking a lot about decriminalization vs. broad legalization. In this scenario, I'm not so sure we will see big tobacco or big alcohol make a meaningful push. Rather, I see any participation coming in the form of strategic investments in the winners (AYRWF, GTBIF, TCNNF, CURLF, CRLBF, CCHWF, etc). So...While I think the LT view you articulated on MO makes sense, they are not going to be the most direct beneficiaries over the next few years. The most direct beneficiaries will be the well-capitalized, vertically integrated US MSOs. I think its important to point this out because while cannabis has a long runway for growth (10+ years), we are at a really unique inflection point in the industry's evolution where the MSOs are going to see big gains off of the bottom driving a level of revenue growth and cash generation that will catch a lot of folks and institutions by surprise and should translate to meaningful share price appreciation. I want to be there for that which is why I am bullish the stocks and the MSOS etf",2,nan,nan,nan
,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.

It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).

Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA .

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.

Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ).

It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury.

SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.

IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury.

The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P.

Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf .

But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think?

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11.

I've long been reluctant to simply throw money into an S&P 500 ETF since the S&P 500 includes hundreds of mediocre companies (see Diworsification). I like ETFs that put a bit more thought into what companies are good enough to invest in. Many of these look like the type of ETF I might put some money into. SFY and DSTL in particular look intriguing.TMFC, The Motley Fool 100 Index ETF, is another ETF I like that I don't see mentioned here. It matches the Motley Fool 100 Index, which is an index of ""the 100 largest, liquid domestic firms... domiciled in the United States and are either active recommendations of a Motley Fool research publication or rank among the 150 highest rated U.S. companies in the Fool analyst opinion database."" I like it because it's basically a crowd-sourced index of 100 great companies based on the analysis of many smart guys hired by Motley Fool to study companies everyday.

It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl .

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11.

Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.","After looking at expense ratios and considering where I'd thought my portfolio is underweight (bonds, emerging markets), I really liked EMXC, IGBH, and NTSX as additions to my portfolio.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often. Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why: THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq . The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA .

It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think?

,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.

The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning. My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work). Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO. A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs. Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""

Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl . Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ). Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think?

If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus #11: 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",That 90/60 is a cool concept! Never heard of something like that before,0,nan,nan,nan
