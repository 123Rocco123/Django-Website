,nan,Capitalism?https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47727TSMC only exists because the Taiwanese government recognized the need for some sort of competitive advantage on the global market. Taiwan invested heavily into the industry and the government is still the largest shareholder.This is a great example of prudent investment by a government and is a great model of private-public partnership in a world that is growing increasingly concerned with nearshoring.,3,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.986

A double power move ""you are part of us whether you agree or not"" and ""your most profitable company is still beneath us. Fast forward to last year and this year, TSMC overtook them due to China crackdown on tech companies and TSMC's rapid rise thanks to AI demand.Back then ,ost Chinese barely cared about it except for the brainless nationalist, but now it's extra ironic especially with current domestic economic situation, even their own citizens made fun of the list and implied government is delusional.",1,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.974

,nan,Doritos or death,5,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,China has a slightly different problem compared to Russia when it comes to invading Taiwan.There is about 100km width of sea in between. China will need a shit load of transport vehicles (ships and transport aircraft) to even have a tiny chance of invading.Remember WW2 Normandy? Now imagine it with modern weapons and techniques.I don't think China has even 5 percent of the transport crafts they will need.Sure they can nuke Taiwan or probably have a decent chance of bombing it hard. Invading? Not any time soon.,3,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Also Taiwan has been getting ready for decades now… armed to the teeth is an understatement,4,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.868
,nan,"its actually about double that distance, its about 100 miles from xiamen to taiwan, or about 190km.While the sea is relatively shallow, its deep enough for short range subs to patrol and deep enough for extensive mining.At full steam, an assault landing ship travels at around 25mph. Fully laden, maybe 20mph. It'd be a 4 hour journey at minimum to the nearest coastline. Plenty of time to get absolutely bombarded with ASMs. Not to mention there'd be at least like 6 months notice as china gathers all the equipment needed. And not even mentioning that they'd also need to actually build all the ships required to stage an invasion. Fishing boats and patrol cutters aren't gonna do it.",4,0.514,POSITIVE,0.978

,nan,It's so fucking stupid. It's the same with Russia.With a decent government that isn't so fucked up both countries would have a way better life today.China almost had it and fucked it up as of knowAnd Russia fucked up since like fucking everI feel so sorry for people who grew up in those countries.

,nan,Hell they didnt even need to do that. They had a good thing going with their fossil fuel machine. Tons of cash and leverage over Europe. They could have played the Taiwan card with Ukraine but more intensely since Ukraine doesn't have a TSMC for the west to have a reason to intervene withThat way they get to bully Ukraine w/o fucking up the global economy. (Note I am NOT advocating for this. Slava Ukraini and all that. I am just speaking from Russia's strategic POV)Instead they said the quiet part out loud and forced intervention. I guess the only upside is hopefully this makes China think twice. And this accelerates Putin's demise even if it doesn't feel like it right now.,4,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.996

Taking over TSMC by force would render its factories inoperable. Liu emphasized that a military takeover would not only disrupt TSMC's operations but also cause significant economic turmoil in China, as it relies on TSMC's products for its advanced componentSource:https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/tsmc-chairman-on-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-nobody-can-control-tsmc-by-force/",2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.981
