Update: Deemed unethical","I agree that there are no formal agreements in place, but the odds are that the US and Japan would defend Taiwan at some level.In fact, the US might be compelled to act because China would likely need to launch major pre-emptive strikes against US bases in the region.Even if they didn't directly sink Chinese warships or shoot down airplanes, they could blockade Chinese shipping in the Persian Gulf and the Malacca Straight.The Chinese have more ships than the US, but most of their ships can't operate more than 1,000 miles away from the Chinese mainland (The Persian Gulf is over 4,000 miles away from China).If the US and Europe imposed the same sanctions on China as they did on Russia, China would undergo a famine and a rapid de-industrialization within a year, due to lack of imports.This would be extremely costly for the US (and the world), of course, but the US is food and energy independent. Only, around 4-6% of US GDP is tied to China where China depends on the US for 13% of GDP.The US (and the whole world) would face a deep recession (at a minimum), but China would likely collapse and break up into multiple countries.",2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.997
