,"Preamble: Totally regarded ape in feces throwing stage of evolution. AAPL is TSMC, in fact so are many others (AMD, NVDA etc.) Are Chinese naval blockades, and Taiwanese elections priced in when considering, for example, AAPL’s valuation?

All this really started being talked about that China will do what Russia did or will be emboldened by Russia. If Taiwan is invaded the world is done as we know it. It’ll either be full out nuclear war or something that completely destroys the global economy. So ask yourself is it an actual “risk” when if it plays out everything is completely and utterly fucked. It’s like saying we should price in an asteroid that could hit earth in the next 3 months. If it doesn’t great if it does it doesn’t matter anyway because everything is gone.,0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
