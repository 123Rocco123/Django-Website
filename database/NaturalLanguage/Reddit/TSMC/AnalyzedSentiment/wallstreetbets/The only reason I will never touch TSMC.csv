I would not be surprised if the Taiwan has TSMC fabs rigged with explosives as a form of mutually assured destruction. Human progress will literally be set back by decades, worldwide disruptions in every supply chain and every sector of the economy. China would be very fucked by this as well as the US. The world simply cannot handle the level of semiconductor production capacity loss in a normal way.Anyway, I am slightly optimistic that it wonâ€™t come to this.
