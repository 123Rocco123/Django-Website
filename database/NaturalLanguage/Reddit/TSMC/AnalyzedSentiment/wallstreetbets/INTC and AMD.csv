You didn't even mention how Intel is the first foundry to actually have ASML's new High NA EUV Lithography machines!  They skipped on regular EUV, and that hurt them, now they are balls deep in the latest in lithography! It's not even finished being developed, so when ASML makes a change, so does Intel to their machine.  Based on past performance, ASML will work out the kinks, and Intel will be the first to reap the benefits on their future nodes. Intel is investing hard into R&D again, like they used to (before they let a non-engineer/business guy be the CEO).  When they will reap the benefits is not clear, but it's a good long term buy anyway (especially considering the dividend)!",0,nan,nan,nan
