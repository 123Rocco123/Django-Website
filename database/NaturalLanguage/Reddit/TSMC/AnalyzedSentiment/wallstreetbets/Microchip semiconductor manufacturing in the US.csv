,"I know Biden just gave $1.5B of the $280B chips and science act money to Global Foundries (GFS). What other companies besides TSMC are building chip or semiconductor manufacturing plants in the United States? What are the better and worse bets amongst them? Is the water scarcity in Phoenix a legitimate reason to prefer chip manufacturing facilities in other parts of the US? Speaking of water scarcity, is IDE water technologies out of Israel worth a bet considering they might be building the largest water desalination plant in the world on the Sea of Cortez for Phoenix? They already have more desalination plants than any other company, most of them are at their home on the Israeli coast.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Both will end up getting huge chunks of the bill. Could also see handouts to TSMC and/or Samsung to get them both to build on US soil.With that much money sloshing around tho, who knows, you could see a bunch of companies try to spin up their own fabs. Though it‚Äôs hard AF, capital intensive AF, and has super long lead times, big tech absolutely has the cash and incentive to go more vertical with their supply chain.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.896

Their work culture, whatever your view on it may be, cannot be easily replicated in the USA or Europe. Not to mention the engineering expertise on the ground after decades of experience in a complicated process. They‚Äôve already had major issues trying to develop a TSMC factory in Arizona, and that is only working on older chips.It may have been a better idea to try to diversify the geopolitical China risk with factories in southeast Asia or Mexico imo.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.998

After all, TSMC are employing and training employees to work at foundries and educating noobs on semiconductors.

If Intel executes on their plan(new equipment and fab), we are talking monopoly on chips. If they fuck up, per usual; they will continue with their lack of productivity. My bosses, bosses, boss was at Intel for 28 years. I flat out asked the guy, is Intel going to turn it around, or what are they waiting for? His was response was, ‚Äú WE WERE TRYING!!!‚ÄùHonestly I have a very bad taste in my mouth from Intel. My grandfather made it big, high 8 almost 9 figures. I spent a lot of time with my grandparents and their closests neighbor was Intel employee #4 or something. He claimed to have started the laptop division at Intel and I would always see him driving his Ferrari around. I loved cars and would always rush outside to watch him drive away. Fast forward 15 years, and I graduated college with chemical engineering degree; and I wanted to work on computer chips. I get the neighbors number from grandparents and I give him a call. He tells me about how great Intel is, how the execs had ‚ÄúFerrari Friday‚Äù, how he was an early employee and all this stuff. I tell him I got an engineering degree and I am ready to work on computer chips. Intel guys asks my gpa and when he finds out it didn‚Äôt start with a 4.0, he immediately tells me Intel only takes the best and I have no chance. Thanks neighbor.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
