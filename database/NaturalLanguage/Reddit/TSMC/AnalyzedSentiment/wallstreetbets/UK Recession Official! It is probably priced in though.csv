,nan,"German here. Very small recession. -0,3 GDP but GDP Debt Ratio of 64 and it did go down for three years in a row. So yeah technical recession But very mild",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Exports dropping by a ton and imports by weight back to the 2015? Let‚Äôs see if this ‚Äúslight‚Äù technical recession is over. The debt ratio is good of course. Not a chance the country will go bankrupt unless italy should do so and the 1 Trillion of loans the German central bank has at the ECB go bye bye. The biggest German problem is of course the tight coupling with China and the big investment into Russia. Both of them don‚Äôt seem to come back anytime soon. Also The US getting more and more protective forcing companies to produce locally. All not really great longterm signals for the high end workshop of the world.I guess the biggest hope is that other countries grow and make up the slack. Like Indonesia or India.,3,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Money printing should be a option, no? Besides that germany is an expert in fuking the other EU countries that are poor and have loans. Greece comes to mind. But yeah Germany is very dependent on partners for energy supply and needs strong global economy for their exports. Not sure if more companies like Tesla could build factories in germany because if we are good in one thing its engineering. Besides that digitalisation is a nightmare in germany",4,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,German could definitely spend more but with unemployment at 3% you wonder what that would do apart from moving people from jobs that are productive to jobs that are less productive ( which tends to be the case when the state just pulls out the Giesskanne ). Like sure numbers will go up but people will not have a better life just more expensive things they really need. In general deficit spending only makes sense if there is a lot of slack in the economy hard to argue that with 3% unemployment. That just leads to 10$ coffees and some rich people juicing the GDP numbers like in the US. Also we get a lot of skilled immigration from EU countries because of the strong companies and a lot of shitty immigration from Lybia but still demographics don‚Äôt look like we should gear up a huge debt burden otherwise we will have to somehow inflate it away like the US will have to do killing retirement accounts for millions of people. In general I think the German government is doing the right thing not to open the sprinklers. However we may be forced to to compete with the US and China doing it to keep industry.And yes we luckily could bully Greece ( which actually seems to have worked well for them ironically ) but not sure we could do the same with Italy. You know the saying if you owe the bank 10000$ you have a problem if you owe it 10 billion dollars they have a problem.Another good thing is that we deflated the housing bubble a bit. This pain will still come in the UK or US. And Germany already got over that quite a bit. And huge hoiuse prices are just terrible for young people and the quality of life in general.So yeah by and large midterm I am also quite positive. Whatever you say Germany has some of the best companies that produce stuff the world needs. And that is always a good foundation and sooner or later there is tons of world wide growth to be had in Asia and hopefully latin america we can hopefully support by selling them stuff to make things and make a tidy profit doing that. Unless we purposefully torpedo it with overzealous environmental and social policies like the insane Lieferkettengesetz.,5,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I agree with most, but I dont mean spend it for jobs nobody needs, but for digitalisation and its Infrastructure. The Internet is a joke. Telekom waits till the until the non existent competition lays fast internet lines and then tears up the road again to build their own. Just one digitalisation fuk up from many.

,nan,For the US it helps when your entire economy is fueled by record debt.For the CCP it helps when you just make shit up.,1,0.513,POSITIVE,0.7
,nan,The ccp also shoveled a ton of debt into the economy through state banks. Its like a company buying stuff from itself to push up revenue. Now if you have 30% youth unemployment that may not be a bad thing if only parts of that money are used productively. Better than people sitting around. And china with a 45% savings rate and huge exports bringing in foreign currencies and the us having the global reserve currency can definitely play this game longer. But it doesn‚Äôt really spell a healthy productive economy in either case,2,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.996
