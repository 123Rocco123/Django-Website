,"On April 4th, I deposited $6K into my brokerage and used all of it to buy next day expiring $META puts. Within 2 hours and 45 minutes, the entire market took a dump and I sold the position for $40.8K. Today, I opened a $16K position into APR26 expiring $160.00 $TSM calls. I believe the fundamentals and performance for TSMC are top notch and have not changed. The earthquake in Taiwan has been confirmed to have had little impact to TSMC operations and should not effect forward looking statements in a considerable way. TSMC is also a unique company in that they report monthly revenue figures. This reporting is expected this Wednesday (4/9/24) and should give clear visibility into earnings which is currently scheduled for 4/18/24. The awarding of Biden's $6.6B U.S. production for TSMC's Arizona foundry is the icing on cake which I believe was not properly baked into the stock during today's trading session. Wanted to post here ahead of time as I've been seeing people only post after their exit. Note: I do not know when I will be selling out of the position. It maybe after the monthly revenue figures on Wednesday if we get a solid beat and the stock rallies. Since revenue figures are posted on a monthly basis, the earnings report is primarily useful for the forecast. If the forecast is anything short of phenomenal, I am expecting a sell the news moment which may not be worth the risk. Also important to note that Wednesday's CPI and FOMC meeting along with Thursday's PPI updates could result in meaningful updates so definitely trade with caution. Lastly, I may or may not add more to this position as this week continues and will keep anyone interested updated! Good luck $TSM + $META positions: https://imgur.com/a/cYEazey EDIT 4/9/24: For those messaging me for an update, I officially exited out of the entire position this morning.

If the forecast is anything short of phenomenal, I am expecting a sell the news moment which may not be worth the risk. Also important to note that Wednesday's CPI and FOMC meeting along with Thursday's PPI updates could result in meaningful updates so definitely trade with caution.

,"On April 4th, I deposited $6K into my brokerage and used all of it to buy next day expiring $META puts. Within 2 hours and 45 minutes, the entire market took a dump and I sold the position for $40.8K. Today, I opened a $16K position into APR26 expiring $160.00 $TSM calls. I believe the fundamentals and performance for TSMC are top notch and have not changed. The earthquake in Taiwan has been confirmed to have had little impact to TSMC operations and should not effect forward looking statements in a considerable way. TSMC is also a unique company in that they report monthly revenue figures. This reporting is expected this Wednesday (4/9/24) and should give clear visibility into earnings which is currently scheduled for 4/18/24. The awarding of Biden's $6.6B U.S. production for TSMC's Arizona foundry is the icing on cake which I believe was not properly baked into the stock during today's trading session. Wanted to post here ahead of time as I've been seeing people only post after their exit. Note: I do not know when I will be selling out of the position. It maybe after the monthly revenue figures on Wednesday if we get a solid beat and the stock rallies. Since revenue figures are posted on a monthly basis, the earnings report is primarily useful for the forecast. If the forecast is anything short of phenomenal, I am expecting a sell the news moment which may not be worth the risk. Also important to note that Wednesday's CPI and FOMC meeting along with Thursday's PPI updates could result in meaningful updates so definitely trade with caution. Lastly, I may or may not add more to this position as this week continues and will keep anyone interested updated!

I do not understand how these puts work.With a META stock price of 520$, you buy the ""put"" with strike 520$ and pay 138$ for each contract. To me, that means that the stock price needs to fall below 382$ (520 - 138) so that you can actually earn some money. Obviously I am wrong, because when the stock price falls to 510$, you sell each contract for 950$.So how these kind of contracts really work?",0,0.565,NEGATIVE,1.0
