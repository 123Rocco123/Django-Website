For the arithmetically challenged, that is a 22.47 percent rise.Yet total revenues were down 16 per cent to $655.85 million due to a 53 percent plunge in licensing to $192.7 million, a company spokesperson told The Register.so, yeah. they're making YUGE royalties from your aforementioned nvda/tsm. it's why their revenue numbers are all so similar!",6,0.583,NEGATIVE,0.998

SoftBank will provide next-generation social infrastructure to support the super-digitalized society in Japan,” said Junichi Miyakawa, president and CEO of SoftBank Corp. “Our collaboration with NVIDIA will help our infrastructure achieve a significantly higher performance with the utilization of AI, including optimization of the RAN. We expect it can also help us reduce energy consumption and create a network of interconnected data centers that can be used to share resources and host a range of generative AI applications.”“Demand for accelerated computing and generative AI is driving a fundamental change in the architecture of data centers,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Grace Hopper is a revolutionary computing platform designed to process and scale-out generative AI services. Like with other visionary initiatives in their past, SoftBank is leading the world to create a telecom network built to host generative AI services.”The new data centers will be more evenly distributed across its footprint than those used in the past, and handle both AI and 5G workloads. This will allow them to better operate at peak capacity with low latency and at substantially lower overall energy costs.",4,0.555,POSITIVE,0.999

Microchip has FPGA SoCs with RISC-V processors. Lots of Chinese vendors are selling essentially STM-compatible ICs with RISC-V MCUs in them. These are starting to get really popular. It's already a pain point for ARM when negotiating new licensing deals. It will only get worse as more advanced RISC-V designs come out.ARM still has a technical advantage in the higher-end CPU designs used in smart watches, mobile phones and tablets, and in having a menu of IP to chose from when designing custom MCUs.
