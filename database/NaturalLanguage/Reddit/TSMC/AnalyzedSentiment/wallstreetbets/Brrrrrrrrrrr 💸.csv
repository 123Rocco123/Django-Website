,nan,Lmao that sucks. I bought 10k worth of XLK ETF shares kinda just let the market do its thing. Life’s easy when you just buy and hold. Its boring. But it’s how I’ve grown 50k to 350 in just a few years.,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"how did you 7x your money in a few years in the ""boring way""? Leveraged NVDA/QQQ?",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Probably. The stock could have moon and gone up above $190-200 if there was no such bearish statements from Trump. Regarding geopolitical risk, TSMC said it is currently their customers who are paying the tariff when the chips are shipped to the US, not them. They also will stick with its current plan for the US fab expansion, but JV option is not on their menu. There is absolutely no reason why the stock tanked if not for that interview.",1,nan,nan,nan

,nan,Joint venture. U.S. politicians prefer JVs to make it easier to steal IP to prop up worthless domestic competitors like Intel.,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Ignoring the fact that said politicians can change the domestic IP law to allow that outright if that’s what they wanted, it’s actually a lot closer to ensuring no monopoly and having a diversified base for needed products. Same reason you shouldn’t own one stock alone.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Politicians can do lots of things, but political blowback sort of exists, so they usually have to consider optics.",5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Who the fuck is paying attention to that as a voting bloc?,6,nan,nan,nan
,nan,,7,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I wouldn't exactly call Intel useless and while it's true that currently they are couple of generations behind TSMC this year could be big for Intel since we should see first products on their new A20 (2nm) node. So as long as Intel doesn't completely give up and US gov continues supporting them they should be fine in the long run. If anything Intel is actually one of the few semiconductor makers that are somewhat safe from geopolitics.,4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,That’s not what JVs are for. That’s what other companies will use JVs for.,4,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"""MR MILLER: So I think I said this yesterday: It’s going to be a tricky few months where I have to walk the line of what I can and can’t say about remarks that are made on the campaign trail. But I will point out that Taiwan has been paying for its own defense. Taiwan has been purchasing military equipment from the United States to the tune of billions of dollars, and the military equipment that they have purchased supports American manufacturing, supports American industry, supports American technology. So the purchases that they have made not only are important, we believe, to regional security, but are important to the United States economy.""https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-17-2024/",1,nan,nan,nan

That’s where the problems lies. If everyone knew they were gonna beat, when the news comes out that they did beat; it’s not a huge market move. I bet we’ll see a green day atleast from TSM but from Geopolitical concerns rising, and Institutional rebalancing; It says investors have less confidence in TSM than they did before.",0,nan,nan,nan
