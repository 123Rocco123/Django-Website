,"Like most of you guys I was initially worried about the earthquake and. TSMC. HOWEVER.... I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire"" AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK. **QUESTIONS TO ASK** 1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans? 2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk? Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks. TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty. |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities. |2008| The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%. |2012| Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage. |2013 Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool. |2015| Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. |2016| Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling. The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market. One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically.

Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks. TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty. |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities. |2008| The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%. |2012| Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage. |2013 Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool. |2015| Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. |2016| Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling. The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade.

Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks. TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty. |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components.

Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession.

In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market. One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically. People in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend’s quakes were not a lot worse",People are forgetting that its their strongest earthquake in 25 yrs which means they have another 25 yrs to pump out more product,1,0.504,POSITIVE,0.82

Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks. TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty. |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components.

If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market. One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically.

Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade.

On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park.

The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market. One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically.

I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire"" AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK. **QUESTIONS TO ASK** 1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans? 2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk? Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks. TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty. |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities. |2008| The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%. |2012| Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage. |2013 Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool. |2015| Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. |2016| Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling. The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market. One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically. People in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend’s quakes were not a lot worse",guaranteed there's a 3-5% dump tomorrow to shake some call holders.

,"Like most of you guys I was initially worried about the earthquake and. TSMC. HOWEVER.... I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire"" AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK. **QUESTIONS TO ASK** 1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans? 2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk? Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks. TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty. |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities. |2008| The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%. |2012| Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage. |2013 Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool. |2015| Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. |2016| Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling. The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: Shock Absorbing Plant Designs “In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. “In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, Nanya Technology has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.” Meanwhile, Micron had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. “Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. “Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.” Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said. Taiwan’s Importance It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market.
