,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West. Also, Intel shares are below $20 a pop right now. Do what you will with this info.",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan

This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel.
