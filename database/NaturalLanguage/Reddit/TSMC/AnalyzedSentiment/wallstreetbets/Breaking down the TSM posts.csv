,"I don't know if its because I am a relatively long time TSM holder (bought first share August 2022 near bottom of 2022 semi conductor crash) or its just the more time I spend here the less cute the stupidity is but the TSM wave has really bothered me recently. So we are going to break down the TSM posts. I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad. I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right. If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop. The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 3 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 5 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 6 Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.",The difference in IQ between that degenerate and this OP is astonishing.Yeah I saw all his posts and didnt touch tsm.

,"I don't know if its because I am a relatively long time TSM holder (bought first share August 2022 near bottom of 2022 semi conductor crash) or its just the more time I spend here the less cute the stupidity is but the TSM wave has really bothered me recently. So we are going to break down the TSM posts. I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad. I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right. If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along.

If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","very true. if Taiwan were to be invaded then the other chip stocks would take big hits for sure.Taiwan is unlikely to be invaded anytime soon, but that hardly matters to the actual stock price.

Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage.

It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

So we are going to break down the TSM posts.

Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle.

So maybe like 115-120 is an OK buying point.""you dont expect a run up into that"" i dont play earnings and i find it extremely cucked for anyone who does. i dont run my investments on short term turn arounds.and just a final note here - if you want to buy TSM at 140 then do it. i like the company and their fundamentals, great company. just dont do it because some dude aggregated a bunch of news articles he found on a forum. thats the point im making with this post.",3,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","This post basically reads as follows: ""Hey guys, IM the one who timed the REAL bottom on TSM.

He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","Half of this sub would be offended by this post, but they don’t read posts without pretty pictures or TLDRs (still would not read the post if you posted the TLDR…they would just read the TLDR and say fuck it I’m in!)",0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

So we are going to break down the TSM posts.

We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international watersThis for me is the only logical reason TSM isn't at least $200, I understand it's a fab, so it's cash flows are limited compared to a combined hardware/software company like nvda or amd, but it's projected cash flows based on current demand alone from chip buyers put's this undervalued, as of writing it's not even at 2021 levels.I'm sure there's more financial garble one could cite for why, but lets be honest, if this was an American based company it would have a p/e wayyyy above 27",0,0.565,NEGATIVE,0.989

So we are going to break down the TSM posts.

I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right.

You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read.

He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price.

We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from.

It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","it would depend. is the gamble a options bet I am guessing? if so what date are we looking at?if you are an mid april player i think its ok to ride it out if you are already down 70%, but again even there we depend a whole fuck ton on what that meanslike is this the last 2k in your account and it going to 0 is the end of the story or what are the details ya know.

This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop. The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 3 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 5 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 6 Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","I’m a long term holder and honestly may 160 are a really solid play.

So we are going to break down the TSM posts.

We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does.

And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader.

In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","TSM has been historically undervalued because of the geopolitical risk.It is 121 miles from China to Taiwan, and China has not minced words about this. They plan to reunify.Now just because they say that doesnt mean they will, and nobody truly knows if they will or they wont. Part of the west pushing back in Ukraine might actually benefit TSM if we can show how badly a thing like that can go. But Russia is not china.Many people believe 2027 is the year, but Pooh Bear has said he doesnt have a date planned.TSM is an amazing company with solid leadership and stellar financials. they sit upon a literal dragons den of cash, pay a decent dividend, make a good product.but that was true all of 2023 when NVDA and MSFT were popping off. So that was a good time to buy. Buying now at ATH. Very shaky ground you sit upon. I like it better sub 130",1,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.857

I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.",But what about my 200c 4/19 calls,0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.938
,"I don't know if its because I am a relatively long time TSM holder (bought first share August 2022 near bottom of 2022 semi conductor crash) or its just the more time I spend here the less cute the stupidity is but the TSM wave has really bothered me recently. So we are going to break down the TSM posts. I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad. I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right. If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop. The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 3 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 5 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 6 Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news.

He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","its super boring but here it is by my equity amount largest to smallestVOOG - VOOG VOT AND VIOG can all be cut for VTITSM - i do not DCA into this but have a large position at 80 dollarsVOTVCITVYM - I dont DCA into this anymore but have a great price. I originally bought this as a ""fixed income"" option over bonds when i was a little baby boy just starting out. Its a large position in my portfolio, makes like 10% a year dividend, and is up 10% which is amazing on a high dividend yield. if rates do go down people will flee money markets and go for dividend, the type of investor looking for some kind of income generation will 100% do that.VIOGVGIT - this can be cut for BND and youd probably be better offVWOVEAVNQBWX - want to get out of this for a small gain like 3%, fuck international bondsVNQIMCD - in at 252, not part of my DCAXTN - in at 70, not part of my DCABCD - want to get out of this for a small gain like 3%, fuck commoditiessave for foreign stock ETFs below this really ends my monthly dollar cost averaging.

Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop. The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 3 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 5 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 6 Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.",i hope you do it for better reasons than some guy aggregated a bunch of SemiWiki posts at you. <3,1,0.511,POSITIVE,0.982

It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.","so semiconductors are about 2 things in the broadest and simplest termshow many transistors you can cram on a chipyield - how many chips out of your batch are good vs how many have to be trashedTSM wins both categories. It has high yield and makes the most cutting edge chips in terms of cramming in transistorsnow thats somewhat misleading, because Samsung also does pretty well in this department.what really made TSM was the model. they didnt bother with design. NVDA designs chips. all TSM does is manufacture them.and because of that over 50% of the market for manufacturing semiconductors is TSM.i dont particularly know GFS but those are the reasons we talk about TSM. because when it comes to making semiconductors they are basically the king. we should not pretend like NO ONE ELSE EXISTS IN THE SPACE THOUGH. so if you like GFS or INTC or Samsung or any other fab and you have good reasons for that then you go ahead and buy it baby boy <3",1,0.521,POSITIVE,0.993

So we are going to break down the TSM posts.

Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

,"I don't know if its because I am a relatively long time TSM holder (bought first share August 2022 near bottom of 2022 semi conductor crash) or its just the more time I spend here the less cute the stupidity is but the TSM wave has really bothered me recently. So we are going to break down the TSM posts. I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad. I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right. If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news.

You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

So we are going to break down the TSM posts. I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad.

You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad. I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right. If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop. The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 3 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 5 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 6 Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage.

This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along. Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop. The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 3 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 5 TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 6 Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage.

The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does.

He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots. You could have gotten the same thing from the yahoo.com news page on TSMC. It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC. And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts - TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle. For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space. All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news. In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news. The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid. I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though. Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling. People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage.

,"I don't know if its because I am a relatively long time TSM holder (bought first share August 2022 near bottom of 2022 semi conductor crash) or its just the more time I spend here the less cute the stupidity is but the TSM wave has really bothered me recently. So we are going to break down the TSM posts. I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad. I want to make it clear that just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right. If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty. You can be right but get there the wrong way Post 1 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub OP talks about a short squeeze. TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw. This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb. We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC. Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies - His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw. we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does. We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here. He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%. https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%. https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/ then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"". and finally we are given his positions. You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position hes already entered for 60k. We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position. I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid. You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading. Post 2 - TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 2 He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up! The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one - Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post. its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from. The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it. We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source). Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along.
