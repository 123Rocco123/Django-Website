It is the great silicone shield around Taiwan.They believe that if they raise prices too much, and take too much profit, other competitors will have a chance to make profit as well.They have been building these long-term partnerships with the biggest technology companies for a very long time.But they have built that technological moat so large, that it is really time for them to take advantage of it to build up Capital to expand exponentially.They hold all of the cards. They really can make up for potential lost profits through minor tweaks to their business.Where the huge gains from tsmc is going to happen, is because the world is going to need a large percentage of additional silicone. And it's not going to be the cheap silicone that everyone can produce.The world will still need the most advanced chips and cell phones, laptops, workstations, graphics cards, servers, data centers, vehicles.But is this going to start to need AI chips in most of those same places.It's like TSM is a farmer and all the sudden there are twice as many mouths to feed in the world.Every $50k/year job, is going to be replaced with an AI chip that costs $20k and lasts 2 years before it's replaced with another $20k chip.A trillion dollars a year worth of Labor is going to be replaced with $500 billion a year worth of robots and chips.",2,0.551,POSITIVE,0.743
