,"What are your thoughts regarding price hikes in the production line and the expected neongas shortage? Fyi: Neongas is an essential part of chip production and about 50% of the worldwide supply came from 2 Ukrainian factories (in Mariupol and Odessa) that obviously can not produce anymore. Chip makers are rumoured to have an good supply of neongas to keep operations running for now, although nobody knows how long they can last. most experts expect them to last around 6 to 9 months and further expect setting up new production facilities could take up to 12 months. My position: Shorted Intel, TSMC, AMD and NVIDIA on Monday, half expiring end of 2022, the other half mid 2023",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
