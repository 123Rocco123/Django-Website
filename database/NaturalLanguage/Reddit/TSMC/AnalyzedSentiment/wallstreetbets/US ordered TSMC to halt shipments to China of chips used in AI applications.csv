,nan,AI war started 🕺,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,AI portion of this war. Trump banned ASML from sending over EUV tech (licensed from US universities to ASML btw) in 2019 to China to stop the microchip industry.,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,This is correct.The US funded the original research that went into EUV and bought it up when the org went bust (EUV LLC).The US then licensed is out to ASML over Canon and Nikon for fear of being too reliant on the Japanese companies.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Nikon has actually had a lot of very advanced (for its time) tech stolen by ASML, and has only recently (like within the last decade or so) settled lawsuits.Interestingly enough, Nikon seems to have just faded away, as most of the settlements seem to look like Nikons capitulation rather than victory.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,it's still crazy to me how Trump (or the US) can ban another country from doing things lol,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Helps that legally ASML doesn't actually own the EUV process. They license it from the American universities. Thats the surface level explanation.The real explanation is that nobody wants to be on USA bad side. Pretty easy to push countries around when you patrol the seas.,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Don’t discount the sea lane work we do. If we cut off shipping lanes from us support, things so bad, very fast.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I just spent 6 months this summer escorting ships to and from Gaza to build a pier and deliver aid.And seeing the straights of Gibraltar crowded as hell because rarely was anyone using the Suez/red sea route due to houthi rocket attacks...The US puts in the work...,5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Any other interesting geopolitical insight?,6,nan,nan,nan
,nan,,7,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"AMERICA, World Police! (Sad but true)",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I mean we all benefit greatly from Pax Americana.,5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"lol patrolling the sea, they forgot Red Sea apparently https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/19/eu-launches-red-sea-naval-mission-to-protect-shipping-from-houthi-attacks",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,lol who do you think is leading that coalition bro? And who do you think does most of the actual bombing? https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/09/politics/us-strikes-houthis-yemen/index.html,5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"I mean, they’ve been doing it for almost a century. There is a reason why the Monroe doctrine is a thing",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,World's only superpower,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,For now.,4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"cry, forever",5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"The countries with the potential industrial (economic and military) capabilities to be a superpower are the United States, EU, and maaaaybe China. China has zero to negative soft power. China has no significant allies (Russia is a gas station more than a reliable ally, North Korea is bonkers). China's military is unproven, although almost certainly better than Russia (so is Ukraine pound-for-pound), they have zero experience in large scale industrialized warfare. The US is in a class all its own economically and militarily, and the English world is culturally dominant in science, film, industry, you name it. Until people start having to learn Chinese to do cutting edge science, start sending their kids to Tsinghua University, start watching movies imported from China en masse, start coding in Chinese, start putting all their savings into China companies (capital controls lmao), start listening to Chinese music, and buying Chinese brands for any reason other than cheap, start seeing Chinese warships on their coasts every single day, etc. etc.Never is a long time but China does not have a good reputation in the west and generally makes garbage products and feeds nationalism within itself. It will never be a global superpower unless it seriously reforms itself and becomes something entirely different from China today.(And as for the EU, it doesn't even have an army.)",5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Don't worry, once the US abandons Europe they won't be able to anymore",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"They can't directly, but they can threaten to stop cooperating, which would be pretty bad for TSMC.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Thinking another country gets a blank check to domestic research is crazy to me. Nobody said they’re not free to develop their own EUV.,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Taiwan is America’s little obedient doggy ofc they can. 🦅 🦅 🗽,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I mean by that logic that same logic that is like pressuring countries not to recognize Taiwan as sovereign nation. China does not have the right to influence the decisions of other countries on who they recognize correct?,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,All you need is a bigger gun pointed at their head compared to the other guy,3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,Grandma's back in business boys!,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Those TSMC chips that were supposed to go to China are gonna flood into the US instead.,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Can someone explain why some regards here think this is gonna send Intel to the moon?Like what, now these Chinese companies are gonna buy from Intel instead?",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Yes that's exactly it. Intel can fill up their older fabs and sell it to china,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Because this is more fuel in the fire that chip manufacturing needs to come back to USA where there can be heightened controls. TSMC are already cooked after finding out their chips are being used in Huawei phones, which is not a good look.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,So you think an increase in the available supply of TSMC chips is going to increase the demand for Intel’s? Interesting theory 😂,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,TSMC has a factory in Arizona now,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"That’s true, but it’s only one site producing last gen 4nm. Intel has Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico & Oregon. Taiwan needs to scrap the laws preventing them from moving their most advanced tech to US. Unless they do that, Intel will be producing the most advanced chips in the USA over the next decade+. And I don’t think that will happen, as Taiwan doesn’t want the business removed from Taiwan for a multitude of reasons.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,3nm fab is already scheduled to come to Arizonahttps://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3122,5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Yup but by the time that is up and running 3nm will again be old tech. TSMC legally has to keep their US fabs 3-4 years behind the leading edge.,6,nan,nan,nan
,nan,,7,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"No. It’s nothing to do with supply, it’s to do with location. Theres a clear geopolitical trend emerging of moving semiconductor manufacturing back onto home soil. China is doing it with SMIC, USA is doing it with the CHIPS act for Intel, TSMC & Samsung. How much do you think the republicans will favour TSMC over Intel over the next 4 years? I would argue 0% chance of that.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"That's unrelated to this news though. In the short term this is going to increase Intel's competition. And the US is definitely not going to cut themselves off from TSMC any time soon. They're getting them to build the plant in Arizona, and Intel doesn't have the capacity or technology to replace them anyway.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"How will this increase Intel’s competition? China is 25% of Intel’s market, if Chinese companies can’t get their hands on TSMC sub 7nm then they become MORE reliant on buying end products from Intel/AMD/Nvidia instead of manufacturing their own Chinese alternatives.",5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"It doesn't matter how much the Republicans will favor Intel, Intel will still waste any money given to them and produce non-competitive chips like they already do.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Intel could provide foundry and some chips to nvidia,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"But nvidia can't even supply the American market, how favoring chip production for the USA could put nvidia at a disadvantage. Nvidia does its business with chips which are not sold in China anyway. They have no need of Intel foundry. TSMC continue to produce for nvidia and could have more possbilities to build his hi-tech chips.",2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"they will be force to divert some of their chips to intel, tsmc also has a site here. theres no way us want 1 company to make all advance chips for them. the government will force them to do it if its a must. consider nvidia profit are sitting at close to 60% they can easily manage to source out a portion to intel.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"But Intel was late on High-NA EUV, they said they will not able to produce with new ASML machines before 2027. So maybe some basic chips which does not require extreme engraving but probably not the most requested items.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"lol Intel isn’t late to have high NA EUV. They are the first one to have high NA EUV. https://www.extremetech.com/computing/report-intel-bought-all-of-asmls-high-na-euv-machines-for-2024 They were late for the last generation EUV but now they are the early adopter for next gen lithography which is high NA EUV. Assuming Intel can get up and running by 2027 as they have projected, TSMC will be the one that have to catch up.",5,nan,nan,nan

,nan,I’ve sold my position in TSM at this point. Been holding shares for a while but even if the company is totally fine I think headlines and geopolitics are gonna make it a shaky hold from here on out. Good luck to anyone trading it.,1,nan,nan,nan
