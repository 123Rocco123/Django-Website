,nan,"Can anyone tell me what's going on with Intel? But use bananas for scale and talk to me like I'm a monkey. I have a 14900k and haven't had any issues, so I'm just wondering what's going on here...",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"I just remember seeing it at the beginning of the year around $40 or so and thought to myself that seems like kind of a bargain for such a big player. Idk, I'm not a guru. Glad I didn't buy then though",1,nan,nan,nan

,nan,Link to that play?And I don't mind slow. Most of my stocks are slow or divs. I try not to take crazy risks anymore. Not since 2020 when I made my money off of Kodak. Worst blunder of 2020 was selling my $200 doge that July. Still crying ðŸ˜¢,3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"Everything tech bought then is doing great. Most other companies are doing great also. I wouldn't keep your goog. They are losing in AI about to lose in search, getting sued every which way, might be broken up or fined, X and tiktok are slowly taking ad dollars from google. Android isn't innovating much and normies are running to apple. You are much better buying a NVDIA or TSLA than own google. Intel is a smart play because its near or below book value and has FABS out side of china.",1,nan,nan,nan
