,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan

It takes years for Gelsinger's plans to play out, this is semiconductors, not Instacart where you launch a new feature in few months.I follow intel a lot and I have 0 clue whether it's gonna be a great turnaround story or it's gonna keep getting worse and worse.If you want to invest in Intel, you can simply wait and see how their 18A node will come out (when, with which yields and which performance/watt results).If their 18A node comes okay, it may save the company and even if you pay 50% more than today, who cares. Otherwise this is risky as fuck because another handful of bad quarters could really put the company in spots we didn't think where possible few years ago.",0,nan,nan,nan

While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.","They laid of a bunch, paused projects and sold some assets.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team.

There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team.

Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that.

This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished.

This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.","I'm responding to what you said - ""This year they are just too far behind AMD in literally the only area they had left"".Seems you have nothing factual or objective to say about it when I asked you about what you meant and mentioned specific product lines; instead you just assume I'm a huge intel investor, which is incorrect.",3,nan,nan,nan
,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will.

Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs.

This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip.

If 18A is delivered on time they will leapfrog TSMC. If they are late, they will still be playing catchup to TSMC 2nm. The only silver lining to missing their target is that customers often don't use the latest node right away, which allows Intel to release products with their nodes that compete with TSMC. Example is that Zen 5 (excluding some server products) and ADA don't use TSMC 3nm, Nvidia's Blackwell isn't even going to be using TSMC 3nm. This will give them a 3 year buffer anyway.",1,nan,nan,nan

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will.

This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs.

,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip.
