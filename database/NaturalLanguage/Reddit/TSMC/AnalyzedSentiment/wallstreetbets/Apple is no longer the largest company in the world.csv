,nan,"Aramco controls all oil and gas production in Saudi Arabia. Aramco has been around for decades, but it was privately held by the Saudi government and royal family during that time. It was always bigger than Apple, but wasn't traded as a stock until recently.",0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.986

,nan,"You obviously have no idea how large Aramco is. It has been the world's largest privately owned company for 50+ years. Aramco's immense proven oil and gas reserves, land holdings, refineries, pipelines, and other assets are incredibly vast. The only other company that rivaled Aramco in size was China Resources, which was broken up into about a dozen mega companies.Apple achieved all of its big success in the 2000s. Apple almost went bankrupt more than once in the 1990s. In contrast, Aramco has been the world's largest energy company since the 1960s.",1,0.567,POSITIVE,0.995
