,nan,"A lot of America centric arrogance in those subs. You'd think nothing got invented anywhere else...As for TSMC, it's not exactly a secret that the outside Taiwan stuff is not their bleeding edge kit. So yeah, not surprising to get better yields with older more established tech.",2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Not to mention TSMC shipped over tons of engineers from Taiwan to run the factory...,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yeah, there is no fucking way that fab is fully populated and actually making product. Test chips maybe. I can picture the inside of that fab in my mind.A corner with the yellow lights where there's a litho tool or two. Half or more of the ballroom floor is covered in pre-install lay down areas. There's possibly at least one tool of a kind for each process step, so a complete line, but no fucking way is it fully up to prod.Probably using 16nm or 7nm or something older for initial quals.And nevermind matching.....The ramp hasn't started. No fucking way.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I mean I drive by there a lot and it's a massive factory with the biggest parking lot I have seen full. They are producing in there while the other building is getting built.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"You'd be surprised at how many heads it takes to build a fab. Just the contractors can easily fill big parking lots. Installing tools is a fuck ton of work.I've started up a few of them in my time---- D1C, D1D, ramps and handoffs at F32, F24, and F28, Samsung S2 and S3, GF F8 and F9....TSMC F21 was supposed to ""start"" production in Q1 this year. There were labor shortages. A quick Google search suggests it'll be up to prod sometime next year at 5/4nm (at least 1 gen behind, which is normal for this).",3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"The article would probably make more sense to you if you listened to their investor call. They are talking about 4nm test runs, which before tooling out the fab for initial production runs in early-mid 2025. They are comparing the yields of those test runs directly to their 4nm production runs in Taiwan.From the article:A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment directly on Cassidy's event and referred to remarks from Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei on a call with investors last week. ""Our first fab entered engineering wafer production in April with 4-nanometer process technology, and the result is highly satisfactory, with a very good yield,"" he said at the time. ""This is an important operational milestone for TSMC and our customers, demonstrating TSMC's strong manufacturing capability and execution.""But, yeah, the article is obviously for investors, not Engineers. Most people don't generally expect Bloomberg to cater to Engineers considering it's a publication typically oriented toward investors.Also, I'm not quite sure why you're doubting that TSMC is capable of replicating their own processes using all the exact same tools. It's not like they haven't built new fans before. They're pretty damn good at it at this point.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I know... so many people in this thread assuming it is old tech when the point of the Arizona plant is to have cutting edge production also up and running in the US. They are targeting 2nm production at the Arizona plant by 2028.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I believe it was a requirement from Taiwan that the US does not get the cutting edge since it would affect how serious US acts as a shield against ChinaDid that change?,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"The politics around Taiwan and the official US position certainly predate their position in manufacturing high end chips. But there have certainly been concerns: https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/17/united-states-taiwan-china-semiconductors-silicon-shield-chips-act-biden/I guess it depends a bit on just what we mean by cutting edge. Yes, Taiwan will probably be doing 3nm when this plant hits 4nm production at scale. But I'm using cutting edge a bit more broadly, because people here are acting like it's going to be a 65nm node and used to make graphing calculators or something.",4,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"Yeah, the article is quoting the tsmc president, who says the comparison is based on ""similar facilities"". The litho machines might be slightly newer and better, or they implemented something new based on what they learned.Parent comment is probably just trolling. (Also the comment on metal layers, been a long time since I was around chip industry directly, but iirc the common defect is the silicon wafer, not the metal.

,nan,And micron is building 200 billion dollar 14000 acre facility in clay New York. Property prices are now 10 to 20 times higher within 1 hour of the new site. They gave them 10% of cost in grants tax exemptions. And are raising the taxes on the residents to cover the states portion of the grants. Unfortunately this also taxes the farmers out so the state can steal the property for back taxes to build solar panel farms. To power the plants. That are building the semiconductors. They act like it‚Äôs actually a good thing. Would have been if they didn‚Äôt screw over families that have owned farms for over 100 years,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,So the farmers properties when up 10 -20x and they are getting screwed..?,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,No farmers taxes went up while residential housing prices went up preexisting homes skyrocketed. Vacant land sat idle but when taxes per acre went up 50% times 100-500 acres and the cost of fertilizer grains went up 300-800% it basically made it where the farmers couldn‚Äôt afford to keep the lands that they grew up on free and clear and still lost to tax auctions. Because ny literally did exactly what they charged Trump with. But they called it a reassessment.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I'm pretty sure solar doesn't produce enough energy for a fab. I also have no idea what I'm talking about.,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,The solar is more so for NYC than for upstate new York. Along with all the wind mills they are building in Lewis county among other high peak wind areas. Because they can‚Äôt build anything in NYC that isn‚Äôt 100% electric powered no gas no oil no wood no coal. The new green energy bill. But they are willing to destroy crop production lands and oxygen production forests to ensure smog reduction in NYC and surrounding communities. Also the off shore wind farms being built 3 miles off shore.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,If they had 10 cents of a brain they would use the already dedicated lands under power lines and between highways that they spend billions to keep clear of growth by using kill all chemicals that pollute the waters from the runoff.

,nan,...4nm...not cutting edge...I bet you're good at losing money.,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,They've explicitly stated that the cutting edge fabs (cutting edge of the cutting edge right now is sub 3nm) will remain in Taiwan.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"When and where and who exactly said that? Be specific, and show me your source. I've worked in the semiconductor fabrication industry for nearly 15 years, and I listen to every call. Really anything beyond 5nm is better than anyone other than TSMC and Samsung can do. Yes, sub 3nm is ""cutting edge"", but so are their 4-5nm fabs. Really, even their 7nm fab is also cutting edge since that's also only done by TSMC and Samsung.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3122""TSMC Arizona‚Äôs first fab is on track to begin production leveraging 4nm technology in first half of 2025. The second fab will produce the world‚Äôs most advanced 2nm process technology with next-generation nanosheet transistors in addition to the previously announced 3nm technology, with production beginning in 2028. The third fab will produce chips using 2nm or more advanced processes, with production beginning by the end of the decade. Each of the three fabs, like all of TSMC‚Äôs advanced fabs, will have cleanroom area approximately double the size of an industry standard logic fab.""It's on their website. Arizona will produce 4nm. The others will produce 3 and 2nm years later, past when they will be cutting edge.Also, if they did produce cutting edge here, why would we need to defend Taiwan? This company is an existential reason for their country's sovereignty.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Nothing in that quote or on their website says what you claimed. No one is questioning that 2nm and 3nm exist, but pretending that 4nm is not also ""cutting edge"" is just plain silly. Again, literally no one else can make anything under 7nm with any reasonably decent yields.",5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"The article linked also clearly states that this is a 4nm facility. You can actually even read the non-paywalled version on Yahoo Finance which says that it's 4nm: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-arizona-chip-production-yields-214250092.htmlIntel produces sub 7nm, but TSMC has already locked in the contracts for most of this stuff which is why they have dominance. They didn't start out successful, but it was locking in customers that allowed them to reinvest into product process dominance. I am not going to apologize for Intel pre 2021 or even pre August 2024 for it's behavior, but the point of my original comment is that TSMC's American fabs are not going to be their best, while Intel's are.I also stress cutting edge because hyperscalers want to overspend, so they want the optimal, high performance expensive stuff, so that is what fundamentally matters: where is the best node produced? That's still TSMC in Taiwan. If it was Intel in America that'd lead to a significant dynamic change, but don't expect TSMC American fabs to achieve that, short of Chinese Aggression.TL;DR: Until TSMC american fabs start producing the most advanced node, this hardly has any impact on the company's finances or on the market.
