,"A few months ago I watch a youtube video really highlighting the threat and potential disruptions to the semiconductor industry worldwide if there was a conflict with Taiwan. And with the recent passage of the CHIPS act the US is working to bolster its own onshore production. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6sCsOdqXQw&t=1941s Those fears are very relevant today and we don't need to see a full scale invasion to see massive disruption in the industry. So, looking into that theme, which semiconductor companies potentially benefit from disruptions with TSMC?",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
