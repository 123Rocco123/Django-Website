,nan,"Could‚Äôve bought more when it dipped back to 180, Taiwan will never allow their advanced chips to be made in the US, I‚Äôd watch for dips and cop",3,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.876
,nan,"this is WSB but I have the same thought - doesn't matter what price I buy it at today, it's guaranteed to beat the market in 5 years. Owning 61% market share of a key backbone supply-chain industry to AI doesn't just 'go away'. Especially when the reason for their dominance is their ability to out produce / manufacture / innovate competitors",2,0.56,POSITIVE,0.767
,nan,"Hahaha exactly, the amount of loss porn posted here is definitely become fetishized here since the meme rally. Even Intel asked Tsmc to make up their production, it‚Äôs basically the aquarium that all these chip companies like nvidia, amd, and Apple basically need to survive as companies, now that it‚Äôs coming to the US, it‚Äôs practically undervaluedTaiwan won‚Äôt ever produce their advanced chips in the US, as mentioned today, it would eliminate Americas interest within the region while China can‚Äôt even afford to risk its collapsing economy on escalation with Taiwan.See r/ChinaWarns",3,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"not really, all factory in arizona will be about 1 gen behind tsmc in taiwan. they can produce 3 and 5 nm right now with another plants being build later for more advance node. its just company business practice to keep the best in their own field to have the edge, but if you can produce 3nm in arizon with imported tsmc engineer then I fail to see why they cant replicate entire advance chip to us if something happens to taiwan. lol",4,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.782

,nan,"HIMX just attended a conference in Scottsdale Arizona, where they showed off some AI / semi tech for potential investors. I wonder if they have something to do with that?
