,"NVIDIA is facing constraints in AI chip supply due to limited CoWoS advanced packaging production capacity at TSMC. To address this, NVIDIA is collaborating with Intel, which will provide about 5,000 units of monthly capacity for advanced packaging services, potentially starting in the second quarter of 2024. Industry sources suggest that Intel's involvement will help alleviate the tight supply of AI chips. Despite Intel's contribution, TSMC remains NVIDIA's primary supplier for advanced packaging, supplying approximately 90% of the capacity. TSMC is ramping up its production capacity, expected to reach nearly 50,000 units in the first quarter of the year. While Intel's capacity accounts for about 10% of the total, it's not involved in NVIDIA's AI chip foundry orders. Intel is expanding its advanced packaging capabilities, offering customers production flexibility with its solutions. The previous shortage of AI chips was attributed to insufficient advanced packaging capacity, tight supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3), and duplicate orders from cloud service providers, which are gradually being resolved. https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/01/31/news-nvidia-expands-advanced-packaging-supply-chain-with-intels-inclusion-diverting-orders-from-tsmc/",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

This is one big circle jerk. Everyone is pointing at each other for supply issues.https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=1_cc-session_c3f7f60a-b4ac-4d53-982c-0196e93dbed4,0,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.999
