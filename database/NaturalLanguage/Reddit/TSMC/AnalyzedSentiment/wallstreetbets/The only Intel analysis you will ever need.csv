,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",They need to fire half of Wall Street analysts and hire you instead lmao,0,0.493,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I'm just the messenger, the actual article was linked in the post itself:)",1,0.573,POSITIVE,0.669
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I went as far as reading the TL:DR part so I upvote,2,0.512,POSITIVE,0.702
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Bro wtf just tell me how I can lose my money,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Bro I didn’t read all that. Calls or puts?

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",This is truly our wallstreetbets.,1,0.505,POSITIVE,0.986
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I wasn't convinced until I saw a map of the Carthaginian and Roman empire from the Punic Wars in 200BC. Then it clicked. Calls on Intel,2,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Not gonna read all that, I’m happy for you though or sorry that happened",0,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.942
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Yeah that's crazy man,1,0.502,POSITIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I JUST saw that right after posing this,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.985
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I JUST saw that right after posing this,1,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.985
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Intel is still a buy, good discount on the long term",1,0.589,POSITIVE,0.994
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",The volume is so low on options for intel. Good luck getting out.,2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",The volume is so low on options for intel. Good luck getting out.,3,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",lol have you seen the volume on the memes here S has 204 on 2 bucks OTM with 130% IVoptions sellers are the ones winning,4,0.508,POSITIVE,0.791
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I bought S $29 strike calls for 1.54 for Friday.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",That is why I have a small position instead of playing options on Intel.,2,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.984
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Dunno much, but if it prints it prints",0,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.997
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Me neither, I just buy calls on random stocks",1,0.568,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",What has this sub turned into..,2,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.998
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",You're telling me this was a casino all along?,3,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",It's like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.,3,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.934
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I could see the $50 maybe printing by august 16th, but the $75 call by Jun 21st... yea...",1,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I sold a May covered call so the market will pump INTC to at least $1 Trillion before May to make me rope.,2,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","The $75 call was just one contract, the $50 3x, either way, acc to the DD of this sub intel gonna explode so you never know",2,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I'm there too. Do I close that -0.01% now and put that into the fourth quarter or do I just keep it for now. I almost sold when it was -60%, and it ended up being fine the next day. Panic trading would have left me with a loss. My longer options are also up a decent amount. A reasonable person would sell the 0.01% loss as well as the 70% gain, but here I am.",1,0.547,POSITIVE,0.994
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design.

Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",You sure you’re not just unemployed?,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.566
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Gottem,1,0.5,POSITIVE,0.998
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I was going to fuck around on 2025 calls and find out, but since the Government rather spend billions on lobster and shrimp, I’ll prolly just get some shares and play it by ear for now. Their earnings have been good and if you’re into astrology for men, there’s a nasty cup and handle on the 5 year chart. Anyways, I’m off to the dumpster.",0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.656
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Bro casually dropped a reference to the first punic war ☠️ I fucking love that.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Post position ghey boi,0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.988
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","FFS, the aderall is strong with this one.",0,0.551,POSITIVE,0.99
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Just buy INTC, AMD, NVDA, and TSM.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","makes sense...if one is down other is up, buy the dip and watch all of them going up!",1,0.554,POSITIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","This “pivot.” Is it in the room with us now?I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Cliff notes version?,0,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.983
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Gotchu, Puts on Oracle bc small graph plus TikTok might get banned",0,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Yes, I agree . I love the customer relationship with INTC.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Wtf is this! Calls or puts?,0,0.502,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","The leading silicon companies trend over decades. Intel has been cheap as chips for a long time because it's not trending in a positive direction. But it feels like they have a moat and a plan, I'm long to the moon, but not looking at my investment until I retire or have enough to pay off my house.",0,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.948
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Intel seems like two companies trying to catch up on one side with TSMC and on the other side with Nvidia while loosing server CPU market share to AMD and ARM, RISC-V.The CEO needs to turn the company around on several fronts:create momentum and stop the talent drain while attracting new talentexecute well the plan on foundry sideon AI side needs a seem-less integration between software and hardware in the popular DL frameworks what Nvidia achieved to do with CUDA todayWin the next wave of datacenter GPU investments against NvidiaIntel might chases two rabbits and catch neither.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Did you copy and paste your MBA Capstone into a Reddit post? I’m an Intel bag holder, but damn that shit’s too long for the WSB crowd.",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I wish I bought Intel in 3rd century B.C.,0,0.521,POSITIVE,0.917
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Missed out on their abacus launch,1,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.97
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Voted up because a lot of text, so must be right.",0,0.506,POSITIVE,0.97
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",What are your positions,0,0.5,POSITIVE,0.829
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",30x 75C 4/19,1,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.939
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",what color is your helmet?,2,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Jensen leather,3,0.502,POSITIVE,0.986
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",What’s your Wendy’s order,4,0.572,POSITIVE,0.91
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Lmao!!,3,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.797
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Damn I thought my 50C 4/19 was risky,2,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.998
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Bless us with thy Screen Shot..,2,0.518,POSITIVE,0.991
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Right there with ya brother,5,0.505,POSITIVE,0.988
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",75 way too high,4,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I’ll be buying on open, thanks",4,0.515,POSITIVE,0.998
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Not pictured - Sold $45c 3/22 today,3,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Tailing this,2,0.5,POSITIVE,0.986

TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades.

However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Finger got a cramp scrolling passed that while reading 2 words a minute,0,0.501,NEGATIVE,1.0

TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I read it all. The only thing that matters in the future is GPUs. If AMD can't even get into the AI space with their decades of GPU experience and time to write their CUDA equivalent, then what hope does Intel have? The best you can say about Intel is that they probably won't go under. But if you want to invest in the future, it's all Nvidia. ",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.554
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history.

Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Intel has much more AI experience than AMD.,1,0.684,NEGATIVE,0.811
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Scrolling through post fast made pretty, blurry colors ooo ooo ooo aaa aaa aaa! 🐒🍌🤤",0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Bagholder spotted.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Does bag contain delicious banana...???

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Bagholder spotted.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",In because DD includes the Roman fucking empire.,0,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.996
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Finally someone that can use a bit of colors...,0,0.517,POSITIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",So 0dte far out of the money calls?,0,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",I have $50 calls for may and I'm not reading all of this holy shit,0,0.586,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","ASML stocks it is.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","You didn't cover the impact of upcoming products from Qualcomm, AMD, and Apple in the client space in detail.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Reddit Inc. has banned Seeking Alpha articles sitewide.To get around this, please repost your comment/thread with the link removed, and the relevant parts of the article copy and pasted.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Reddit Inc. has banned Seeking Alpha articles sitewide.To get around this, please repost your comment/thread with the link removed, and the relevant parts of the article copy and pasted.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Sorry you had me at SMGB,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.643
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Didn't read.You wrote ALL THIS SHIT to tell us if CEO good stock good and vice versa?You can't be fucking serious.,0,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0

TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",$rycey will triple by 2030,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.995
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Don't announce Intel dead so fast.

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","Key takeaway - ""Performance is not comparable to the H100"", it should be the title to save our time.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",Invest in SoundHound ASAP,0,0.513,POSITIVE,0.846
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",My amd205 call is fk now….

,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.","I did not read a single word but I saw a Map of Roman empire, is that bullish or bearish",0,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Below is copy pasted from article I found online. Here is the original source. Also, I had to remove some other info that I thought was fluff, as reddit has a 40k character limit. TL;DR: if NEW CEO do well, stock go up. If new CEO do bad, stock go down. Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read. Intel’s fall The big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: Additionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: As a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market, partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: “In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise, it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments. But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a little bit into play.” In the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an obvious market share winner. Overall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending, and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. Return of the jedi Gelsinger previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age 18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor based on employee reviews. Moving at lightning speed The key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021. He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5 technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating the market on his plan during the recent call: “First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4 and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then, gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and gate-all-around. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for desktops will be heading there shortly.” The momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10 billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. The five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures than its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3 node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below: Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years This is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: “Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025.” Intel 3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow of other leading edge customers. Below is Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery: “PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well, the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said, “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third generation here. We also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital, enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start, and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to go give them what they need. Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona IDM 2.0 Intel’s new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer, the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process technologies in the case of TSMC. What Intel is trying to accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L, generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin. Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking could allocate costs to. This is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year: “Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model. Our pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better financial performance. Since our founding in 1968, we have been an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic consequence or accountability. And we had a rapid ramp up and down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60% range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly successful. The semiconductor industry — and computing in general — has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all capacity to the next node. The IDM model provides four key advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership. Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services that will further strengthen our capabilities. As we transition to IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L. Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0. Pivoting from allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units. For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L. Leading fabless and foundry competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results. Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin percentage.” Later on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin of somewhere in the 60s. Intel’s 60% gross margin target could be doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. Note that IFS will have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion. This is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model: “While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots, they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output. In the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down, the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows, and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1 billion over time. Next up is test and sort cost. As we shift to the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing. Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over time. Product business units will leverage stable pricing, which will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1 billion. Overall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal. Everyone on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two, supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four, world-class service levels. Intel Foundry Services will have the authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with data separation as key in our systems design.” The cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs. Intel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call: “Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots, and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.” Intel’s recent foundry day Intel held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen? Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world. Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is 80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the world.” So Intel’s P nodes are basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s latest high-NA tool: The foundry opportunity So far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business. However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced semiconductors from US soil. As most will be aware, Taiwan is currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for control of Sicily: Below is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS. If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x, would give an IRR of 36%: Now, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to 50x: Whereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node, which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: As wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes such as 18A and 14A. The foundry business model on lagging nodes is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi designers will source from them anyways. The above TSMC chart also shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around 45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. This is not out of reach — the company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3 years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year, so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term. Intel has as drawback however that its other business units are directly competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase their R&D budget to compete with you. AMD has so far shown no interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big boon for Intel shareholders. New datacenter CPUs So the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and ARM-based custom silicon. Overall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to predict. Intel’s AI strategy The company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense for some workloads. The company is also developing its oneAPI computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs. Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market. Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market Finally, we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior process technologies than AMD: I suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. And currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client product roadmap: So it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads. Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq As a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap. You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters. A lot of semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is not overly concerning. Intel’s CFO added some details: “While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG (FPGAs). With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024. We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network and edge products. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion.” So bringing this all together, we have the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs, this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years should be decent. Management is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year: “We still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 - '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the 30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.” Obviously this would be great as it would allow the business to already turn FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF. This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.",But where are my dividends now??,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.97
