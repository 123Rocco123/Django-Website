,"Hey fam, Let's talk Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and how it stands in the face of the escalating geopolitical drama around Taiwan. TSMC, the heart of global chipmaking, is smack in the middle of this tension. If things go south, what’s the play with Intel? Why Taiwan Matters: Taiwan is HUGE in the semiconductor game because of TSMC. It’s the backbone of the supply chain that feeds giants like Apple and Nvidia. But with China’s eyes firmly set on Taiwan, there’s a real risk to stability here. TSMC’s Tight Spot: Long story short – TSMC is in a geopolitical hotspot. Any military or political upheaval could lead to serious disruptions. We’re talking damaged facilities, production halts, and potentially losing market share if clients start looking for stability elsewhere. It’s impossible to overstate how much would be lost if a hot conflict erupts. I would expect TSMC, & to go to ZERO - 5 minuites after a shooting starts. TSMC has built in failsafes to destroy some aspects of their fab if China tried to take them by force. Intel’s Edge: Here’s where Intel could swoop in. Unlike TSMC, Intel’s got a hefty chunk of its manufacturing stateside and in the EU. They’ve been pouring cash into expanding their U.S. fabs, which could be a massive advantage if TSMC gets hit. Bottom Line: Betting on Intel could be a smart move. They’re set up to handle the fallout if Taiwan's situation goes sideways, likely going back to 90’s level market share and emerging even stronger with contracts from what’s left of NVIDIA. What’s your take? Bullish on Intel given these factors, or is there too much uncertainty in the chip sector right now? Would love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this! TLDR - I’m not an optimist. In the longterm, I think that war or political conflict over Taiwan is inevitable. That being the case, if Taiwan goes down, TSMC goes down. If TSMC goes down, NVIDIA go down too. Who’s left in this scenario? Intel. That’s the only real game in town after this shit.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"Hey fam, Let's talk Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and how it stands in the face of the escalating geopolitical drama around Taiwan. TSMC, the heart of global chipmaking, is smack in the middle of this tension. If things go south, what’s the play with Intel? Why Taiwan Matters: Taiwan is HUGE in the semiconductor game because of TSMC. It’s the backbone of the supply chain that feeds giants like Apple and Nvidia. But with China’s eyes firmly set on Taiwan, there’s a real risk to stability here. TSMC’s Tight Spot: Long story short – TSMC is in a geopolitical hotspot. Any military or political upheaval could lead to serious disruptions. We’re talking damaged facilities, production halts, and potentially losing market share if clients start looking for stability elsewhere. It’s impossible to overstate how much would be lost if a hot conflict erupts. I would expect TSMC, & to go to ZERO - 5 minuites after a shooting starts. TSMC has built in failsafes to destroy some aspects of their fab if China tried to take them by force. Intel’s Edge: Here’s where Intel could swoop in. Unlike TSMC, Intel’s got a hefty chunk of its manufacturing stateside and in the EU. They’ve been pouring cash into expanding their U.S. fabs, which could be a massive advantage if TSMC gets hit. Bottom Line: Betting on Intel could be a smart move. They’re set up to handle the fallout if Taiwan's situation goes sideways, likely going back to 90’s level market share and emerging even stronger with contracts from what’s left of NVIDIA. What’s your take? Bullish on Intel given these factors, or is there too much uncertainty in the chip sector right now? Would love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this!

Intel uses a lot of partners in Taiwan - including TSMC that is used in the supply chain. All those partners would basically halt the global supply of most semiconductors. A conflict in that region would also temporarily halt the demand of chips. It's really a lose/lose for all companies - I don't know of any winners in this scenario.But - I can think of some good reasons to own Intel for a 2025 turn around:Intel will have a state of the art fab with the 18A process starting some time next year. The fab will have clients outside of Intel (including Microsoft).Intel is starting to compete with AI and it should only get better from here with Gaudi 3, Lunar Lake (laptop + handheld CPU) in 2024 , and a dedicated AI server GPU (Falcon Shores) in 2025, and Arrow Lake/Panther Lake in 2025 for the desktop AI CPUs.Much improved discrete Battlemage GPUs should finally be available in the near future as well.I see Intel having a really rough 2024 - but I think in 2025 people will start seeing the potential. I am definitely buying Intel stock at these lower prices.",0,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.998

,"Hey fam, Let's talk Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and how it stands in the face of the escalating geopolitical drama around Taiwan. TSMC, the heart of global chipmaking, is smack in the middle of this tension. If things go south, what’s the play with Intel? Why Taiwan Matters: Taiwan is HUGE in the semiconductor game because of TSMC. It’s the backbone of the supply chain that feeds giants like Apple and Nvidia. But with China’s eyes firmly set on Taiwan, there’s a real risk to stability here. TSMC’s Tight Spot: Long story short – TSMC is in a geopolitical hotspot.

TSMC has built in failsafes to destroy some aspects of their fab if China tried to take them by force. Intel’s Edge: Here’s where Intel could swoop in. Unlike TSMC, Intel’s got a hefty chunk of its manufacturing stateside and in the EU. They’ve been pouring cash into expanding their U.S. fabs, which could be a massive advantage if TSMC gets hit. Bottom Line: Betting on Intel could be a smart move.

Unlike TSMC, Intel’s got a hefty chunk of its manufacturing stateside and in the EU. They’ve been pouring cash into expanding their U.S. fabs, which could be a massive advantage if TSMC gets hit. Bottom Line: Betting on Intel could be a smart move. They’re set up to handle the fallout if Taiwan's situation goes sideways, likely going back to 90’s level market share and emerging even stronger with contracts from what’s left of NVIDIA. What’s your take? Bullish on Intel given these factors, or is there too much uncertainty in the chip sector right now? Would love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this! TLDR - I’m not an optimist. In the longterm, I think that war or political conflict over Taiwan is inevitable. That being the case, if Taiwan goes down, TSMC goes down. If TSMC goes down, NVIDIA go down too. Who’s left in this scenario? Intel. That’s the only real game in town after this shit.","My grandpa was also waiting for the Taiwan-China war since 1949.

,"Hey fam, Let's talk Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and how it stands in the face of the escalating geopolitical drama around Taiwan. TSMC, the heart of global chipmaking, is smack in the middle of this tension. If things go south, what’s the play with Intel? Why Taiwan Matters: Taiwan is HUGE in the semiconductor game because of TSMC. It’s the backbone of the supply chain that feeds giants like Apple and Nvidia. But with China’s eyes firmly set on Taiwan, there’s a real risk to stability here. TSMC’s Tight Spot: Long story short – TSMC is in a geopolitical hotspot. Any military or political upheaval could lead to serious disruptions. We’re talking damaged facilities, production halts, and potentially losing market share if clients start looking for stability elsewhere. It’s impossible to overstate how much would be lost if a hot conflict erupts. I would expect TSMC, & to go to ZERO - 5 minuites after a shooting starts. TSMC has built in failsafes to destroy some aspects of their fab if China tried to take them by force. Intel’s Edge: Here’s where Intel could swoop in.
