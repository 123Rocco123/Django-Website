,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",This sub needs more solid DD like this. Several years ago we had DD like this on a regular basis.,0,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.534

Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Thanks for spoiling me for a change.,1,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.987
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions.

Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",I skimmed but because this is pinned I will be investing 5-10% of my portfolio in ECL today.,3,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.946
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water.

Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Zero valuation talk. Pretty much useless.,1,0.506,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence.

I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",No problem need to get to a personal pc !remind me 4 hours,1,0.508,POSITIVE,0.985
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested.

After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",I am working on a big DD post ill be doing on monday that also mentions ecolabs in part. There is a reason why Gates and hedge funds are buying this stock (and a few others) that you have barely scratched the surface of,2,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.995
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country.

Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Lol you'll have to wait until Monday like everyone else.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji!

It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Here it is, the answer is PFAS remediation!",6,0.503,NEGATIVE,0.905
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy.

Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Oh shit. I didn't get a reminder.,3,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions.

Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",I also want to see u/slut_spoiler ‘s penis,1,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.995

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4.

Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",I grew up watching Peter North,1,0.558,POSITIVE,0.976
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it!

In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Damn, that was a pain in the ass.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons.

To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","What is this, positions for ants?",2,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.998
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity.

Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",At least I have girlfriends,4,0.51,POSITIVE,0.983
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon.

The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Wow, this looks great.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up.

After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",For that he has my undying loyalty.,2,0.502,POSITIVE,0.999
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips).

Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it.

Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Thank you!,1,0.495,POSITIVE,0.93
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends.

Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",New 52 week high. Winning.,3,0.65,POSITIVE,0.998
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame.

This is what it said (GPT-4):Credibility Analysis:The document relies heavily on speculation and lacks substantial evidence to fully back its claims. It assumes that Gates' farmland holdings and his stake in ECL are directly connected, which isn't substantiated. Moreover, the connection between farmland ownership and semiconductor water supply is not well explained. While it's true that semiconductors require pure water, the argument lacks specific details on how Gates would facilitate this transition from farmland to semiconductor manufacturing.In terms of financial analysis, the author provides some useful information about ECL's recent performance, though the focus on Gates' purchases rather than a more thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals is a limitation.Logical rating: 5/10Investment Suggestion:While the underlying logic in some parts of the argument is flawed or overly speculative, the focus on water scarcity and treatment could be a viable long-term theme for investment. However, it would be better to conduct a more detailed analysis of ECL and other companies in the sector before making any investment decisions.The potential for water to become a more valued resource in the future due to climate change and population growth is indeed real. However, basing an investment thesis primarily on the actions of a single individual (in this case, Bill Gates) is risky and may not provide a comprehensive view of the industry's potential.In conclusion, while ECL might be a solid company to invest in, this should be determined through a thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals, competitive position, and the broader market trends, rather than relying primarily on speculative associations.",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them.

Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","It takes tinfoil to make tendies. Although I do rely heavily on ecolabs being part of this super city infrastructure, I also believe that TSMC and Intel will be getting what they need to secure the military complex interest is high grade chips.They wouldn't risk over $100 billions to be stopped short.Also, I think you have to include the links for gpt to read.",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful.

The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world.

Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Doesn’t change anything.,3,0.5,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc...

You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits.

Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Generic response with the ticker and a few bullet points copied from the DD.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it!

In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",goddamn a well written DD in 2023?? Now we wait for the real DD which will appear any moment in the comments,0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.997
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times).

To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",How can you paste this much into ChatGPT doesn't it have a limit of how much you can paste into the chat box?,1,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.973
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world.

Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Probably because of 15 years of consistently beating the market by 1.87%..the charts a thing of beauty long term..After its fall it just recently went into golden Cross on daily.. and Price has finally opened above the weekly 200ema..could take another 3 months before the 50 ema will Cross the 200ema..The OP did a good job on finding this stock too bad. I can't trade it..,1,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc...

You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits.

This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Immediately pinned.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock.

So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Immediately pinned. Short it.Better ?,2,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips).

Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",I’ll keep my eye on it!

This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","VSCO was a wild ride.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement.

My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","He's the largest shareholder.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3.

After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","bill gates also backed an energy startup turned SPAC that is now trading at 29 cents.just sayin, bill gates investing in something doesn't really mean much.edit: i just realized OP is the genius who thought that amd's secret weapon was... having intel fab for them. this DD/theory may require more than a few grains of the white stuff.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips).

""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",He invested in Melinda too. 🥲,1,0.507,POSITIVE,0.962
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Upvoted for the effort!

Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","😂 on Gary, Indiana.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement.

My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","It's UPW, cooling water, water reclamation, municipal waste treatment, and much more.",1,0.513,POSITIVE,0.988
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3.

The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Ya? What is the fair value of the company ?,1,0.71,NEGATIVE,0.98
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste.

Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Up 18% past 3 months? This the dump zone,0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country.

Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Yup. That deserves its own post, but my fingers hurt.",1,0.501,NEGATIVE,0.994

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water.

Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use.

If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Welp, now that they know you know about their secrets in ""the back"", you're done for.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.988
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about.

Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",You ever wonder makes that special sauce so special?,1,0.507,POSITIVE,0.997
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting.

Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?!

It's 3 extra large facilities being built, and what you're talking about is raw water for agriculture, which will not be what is used. You're basically saying you've solved the water problem cause people can drink out of the river. The raw water has too many fluctuations and not enough control.You can look up 2001 Intel incident where high urea ruined a batch of wafers. Standards and water usage have increased since then as wafers get more advanced and sensitive to killer particles.Taiwan is in a tropical climate surrounded by the ocean and still struggles with occasional droughts that effect their facilitoes production. If they can't figure it out by just ""building a purifying plant"" after this entire time, why do you think it will be so easy for Arizona that's already under tight regulations?TSMC and Intel and the city of Phoenix will most likely be making a closed loop water system like a stage 3 maybe even 4 (did you see the water from feces article I linked in there?)

He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Tell me more about this magic water that isn't raw water. All water found in nature is raw water. water table, lake, ocean, or river, it's all raw water. You seem to think water purifying is going to make you money. It's not. This is low hanging fruit. Getting water contaminates removed so that they are less than a few parts per billion will be cost intensive, but ultimately cheap compared to everything else in the project. Water testing isn't a high margin business. methods to purify water are are cost intensive on the front end. Once set up the maintenance is minimal. Farms use closed loop systems all the time. What the companies are doing isn't new. This is nothing but a cost center for tsmc and intel. Unfortunately for your analysis, the margins on water are razor thin. Water servicing will bring in some money, but, it's for a hand full of facilities. That is not a catalyst. Now if standards changed for say, potable water in every state in the US., sign me up. ECL will boom. That's not the case.Having spent time in Taiwan, their production problems have more to do with infrastructure than weather.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use.

No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Check my link to az water. 3 trillion gallons available. They might need to build a pipe line or a canal.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this?

It's due to creating a city centered around a central idea is a huge risk. One big example is Detroit. I do believe that Ecolabs will jump substantially high (most likely not anytime soon) due to chips being a driving point in a most if not all of technology currently.""This won't make me rich!"" is a bearish statement to me for a bullish company. I can see buying calls on ECL is a smart move, the problem is predicting when. At any point this year or next, they could finish their projects, but as you've said that is quite a substantial amount of water theyll need to move for chip production and another water purification company could startup with more media coverage for popularity if it takes too long. I also don't believe Gates is investing into water for the returns. Im pretty sure he's trying to get his karma up so he doesn't go to hell when he dies judging by his attempts to better humankind since all billionaires go to hell according to society.Then again,"" Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. ""maybe he retired from Microsoft to become a full fledged super villain, investing before he commits to sabotaging life so he has more money for more dastardly deeds.I want to add that I probably won't be investing into ECL though, mostly because of the high potential long length of time needed that I currently don't have.

,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Thank youA nuclear powered smart city is entirely posssible. They are already setting it up as a tech capital for data, chips, and Tech edcuation. You will have the smartest people in the world living there.

The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6.

I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it.

TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4.

Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",New 52 week high. Eat that you jive ass turkey,1,0.587,POSITIVE,0.814
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it!

In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","When a post is pinned, people don't upvote it.",1,0.494,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC.

The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Well fucking done my friend.  ,0,0.534,POSITIVE,0.964
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world.

In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Didn’t read but I’m bullish long term on water. ETFs like $PHO which I believe hold this stonk,0,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc...

The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",Yeah I know a former VP of exxon mobile and he said the exact same thing lol,2,0.605,POSITIVE,0.821
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up.

Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste. They recycle it. This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group NALCO. Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation. See where I am going with this? Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011. I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at $38.80 per share. It has pretty much been forgotten about. If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (    Spoiler Alert:     ): Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy. It operates through the following segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Energy & Life Science, and Other. The Global Industrial segment consists of the water, food and beverage, paper, and downstream operating segments. It offers water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions to industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, pulp and paper, commercial laundry, global petroleum, and petrochemical industries. The Global Institutional & Specialty segment consists of the institutional, specialty and healthcare operating segments. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education, and retail industries. The Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment includes the healthcare and life sciences operations. It provides cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The Other segment includes Pest Elimination operations, which provide services to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, CTG operations, which produce and sell colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water used for binding and polishing applications, and Textile Care operations, which provide products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management and reduction, and real time data management. The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc However looking into NALCO... They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers. Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water Have a section on UPW Announced they are working with Microsoft More Intresting Microsoft news AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix. Remember where those space age facilities are going? 50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now. Trust me bro. I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine. https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726. I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"". This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet. The Plants are still being built. If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona. The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock. This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon. When they do, I THINK the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment, carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up. The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL. Bill Gates has done it for you. 3. William Henry Gates III I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks. My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile, and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan. If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft. This isn't a surprise as the largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself. He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022. Billy knows a LOT about the semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame. The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona and is investing in water thirsty nuclear power. Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water. Doesn't Mention the 50% in $MLNDA 🤔 Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5: I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident). Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert. Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves. Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and anything / anyone else he can use. It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure. He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future. Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some. Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice. With wells already dug and everything. What Luck! It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants. Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water. Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse. They are used to dump waste water into though. The top land per state is: Louisiana Arkansas Arizona Nebraska Washington That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"". I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood. Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA. Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji! I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""global warming causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on. The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers. Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc... What he wants to do: Smart City of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch. I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part. 4. The Stock At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership. Last Buy was August of 2022. Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67. Wish it was cheaper. If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish. Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon. You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48. Probably for taxes. Probably... Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc... In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss. You see a steep decline from late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively, as well as higher costs affecting their profits. This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart. There is your sell. Here is there 2022 financial statement. Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk). 2022 annual report for ECL financials Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends. Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are being sued by a bankrupt company. NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit. Sales increased, of course. Growing demand for water control/automation and squeezing out every drop at peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade. 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation. Their bread and butter. Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them. Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts. Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends. Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this. As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions. There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further. Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc. The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap. After that it's free game. However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs. Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds. There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment. It's all about the control and efficacy of water. Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country. The Carpet is Ohio Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. Holy Shit. Just like Bill Gates had an investment in vaccines pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?! The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue. 6. Further Reading Some links I've saved: United Nations’ first major confab on water security since 1977 Analyst opinions (I didn't even read this lol) Future Stuff These are the other EcoLab Companies and what they do and people should look into them. I think they deserver their own post by someone smarter than me: CID Lines (Agriculture. This Explains Nebraska Land) (2021) brochure for Bird Flu. Wow, that Gates must have a 4-leaf clover in his pocket!!! We are in the midst of The worst bird-flu outbreak in US history [and it's] 'wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before.' Here's what you need to know (Apr 2023). How does he do it?! It's like he just knows a virus is coming. Purolite (Makes Agrose) Agrose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis. Agarose is an inherently soft material, so we use sophisticated emulsification and crosslinking technologies to increase rigidity. Anios (Growing global Sanitation) A lingering lesson from Covid is the high demand of sanitation, which will become one of the major industries in the growing third world. Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing. As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer. To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control. The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be. by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure. My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls in a few months. This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. ""But that won't make me rich!"" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it. Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this. Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.","Try Ctrl+f ""TLDR""",1,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.998
,"Sup Sluts, I'll put the TL;DR in the beginning so you don't have to tire your scroll wheel finger. You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn: 0. TLDR A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈. I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects. Bill Gates is invested. Table of Contents: Intro Water and Chips William Henry Gates III The Stock Water Treatment and Sanitation Further Reading 1. Intro Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series. A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting. I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century. I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts. This one is specifically about $ECL. I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter. I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit. I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion). At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt. ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say. So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more. There are really two different angles here that I will discuss. The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion. The Trick Is To Let Them Cook 2. Water and Chips The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it. It Was There That I Started To Question About Water What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries. Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task. To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately 2,200 gallons of water; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below). So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to 4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day. This equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty). wow. numbers man... crazy. Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is. If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would. FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size. It holds about 660,000 US gallons. Which means, that for a large facility, you would need 7.3 of these fuckers full of water a day (copy and paste this image 7.3 times). In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan, droughts can bring production to a screeching halt. Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC. The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way. Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and the Water Wars are already starting. I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that. Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are not going to happen I would be grateful. So, why do they need so much water? A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water. But, it's not just water. It's Ultra Pure Water. Ultra Pure Water (UPW) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water. The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB. No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2. From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive. So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain. There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste.
