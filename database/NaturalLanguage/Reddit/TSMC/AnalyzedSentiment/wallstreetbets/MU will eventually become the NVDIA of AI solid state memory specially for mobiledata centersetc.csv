Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned."" msn.com/ Motley Article that came out today 3-31-24 = (discounting their dominance in their cutting edge Server that came out the 9400 SSD. 77% less power4 better prfmnc=THE BEST IN INDUSTRY) ""..in AI servers, the company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is being deployed by Nvidia. The graphics specialist recently announced its next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs (graphics processing units), and Micron points out that these chips carry 33% more HBM. Micron says that AI-enabled PCs could be equipped with 40% to 80% more DRAM content as compared to usual PCs. On the other hand, Micron expects AI-capable smartphones to ""carry 50 to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non-AI flagship phones today. That's why investors would do well to buy the stock right away.
