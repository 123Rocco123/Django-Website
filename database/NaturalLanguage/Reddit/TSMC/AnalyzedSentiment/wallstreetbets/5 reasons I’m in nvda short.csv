,"Nvidia‚Äôs q2 performance was great but the market was expecting it better because nvidia has been taking over Apple‚Äôs place. Tell you guys why I‚Äôm against nvidia tho this company is great and I still see the potential for the ai boom Slowing down the growth : Like I said the market expects nvda‚Äôs higher growth. Compared to apple, Microsoft, except for the growth and profit rate, everything else is lower than the other two. Delay of Blackwell There‚Äôs a bit of delay of the product. No matter how early or late they can produce it. It just increases uncertainty like Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi day. Lower net profit margin The company still has super high net profit margin but in q2 it‚Äôs a bit lower than last quarter and it will go down next quarter too since tsmc has increased manufacturing cost. Buyback It smells so sus. The company seems to try to cover something so has announced buyback while the ceo and insiders have been selling the shares and this also proves the Blackwell delay. Seasonal short month September is one of dip months! Today the market seems alright with all the indices like jobless, pce and gdp but there‚Äôs a lot of selling. What if the market takes a break for a couple of weeks? This is my very personal view that have been watching nvidia since last year and missed out!

NVDA has specialized in AI hardware that is extremely inefficient compared to what the hardware of the future will be. AI was invented by Nature about 750 million years ago, and these systems work way more efficiently than the current state of the art AI-systems.Recently it has been shown that if you design a neural network more like how a simple brain works, then such a neural network of just 19 neurons can be used to train a self-driving car with good results. The conventional way of going about this requires a conventional neural network of a hundred thousand neurons and a massive amount of training, during which the power use is also quite large. And the performance is then not as good as with the 19-neuron system.These so-called ""liquid neural networks"" cannot yet be efficiently implemented in hardware, they are emulated in software. In the near future we'll likely be able to get to an efficient hardware implementation of liquid neural networks and then a new AI revolution will start, which will make all the investments in the current AI systems obsolete.So, NVDA can best be compared to a company of the 1950s that was manufacturing vacuum tube computers. At the time these huge computers that needed to be housed in their own special purpose buildings, were revolutionary. However, at the time investors were not going crazy about this, they were not pricing in a scenario where every company would buy such a massive computer, they were not investing in construction companies due to pricing in that each such computer would then need to be housed in a special purpose building.Today investors have gone crazy and have priced in totally unrealistic scenarios involving extremely inefficient AI systems being operated by a vast number of companies that require their own powerplants. Just consider here that your brain runs on just 25 Watt, not 25 Megawatt!",0,nan,nan,nan

Buyback It smells so sus. The company seems to try to cover something so has announced buyback while the ceo and insiders have been selling the shares and this also proves the Blackwell delay. Seasonal short month September is one of dip months! Today the market seems alright with all the indices like jobless, pce and gdp but there‚Äôs a lot of selling. What if the market takes a break for a couple of weeks? This is my very personal view that have been watching nvidia since last year and missed out! But I succeed to make a profit from nvidia 3x inverse when it hit $140 and also nvidia x3 leverage when It hit $90 lately. I love this company but I‚Äôm trying conservatively to see into it Sorry about my English","Neural circuit policies enabling auditable autonomy. Nature Machine Intelligence, 2(10), 642‚Äì652 | 10.1038/s42256-020-00237-3:We develop compact representations called neural circuit policies (NCPs), where each neuron has increased computational capabilities compared with contemporary deep models. We show that NCPs lead to sparse networks that are more easily interpretable and demonstrate this in the context of autonomous driving.We discovered that for the lane-keeping task mentioned above, very small networks of brain-inspired neural models (that is, networks with a control compartment consisting of only 19 neurons), in combination with compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs), achieved superior performance, compared with state-of-the-art models, in learning how to steer a vehicle directly from high-dimensional inputs. Here we use the representation-learning challenges as the main criteria for assessing the performance of autonomous-control agents.The network structure of NCPs is inspired by the wiring diagram of the C. elegans nematode. Many neural circuits within the nematode‚Äôs nervous system are constructed by a distinct four-layer hierarchical network topology. They receive environmental observations through sensory neurons. These are passed on to inter-neurons and command neurons, which generate an output decision.Finally, this decision is passed to the motor neurons to actuate its muscles. The wiring diagram of C. elegans achieves a sparsity of around 90% (ref. 6), with predominantly feedforward connections from sen sors to intermediate neurons, highly recurrent connections among inter-neurons and command neurons, and feedforward connections from command neurons to motor neurons.This specific topology was shown to have attractive computational advantages, such as, efficient distributed control, requiring a small number of neurons6, hierarchical temporal dynamics, robot-learning capabilities and maximal information propagation in sparse-flow networks.",2,nan,nan,nan
