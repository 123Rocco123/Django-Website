,nan,this was like in November or something when he sold.,0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,"If china invades Taiwan, all stocks will go down.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"""Silicon shield"" - China relies on TSM to produce 70% of their chips, if they invade Taiwan they would be fucking themselvesWithout a doubt, the first Chinese bomb or rocket that should fall on the island would make the supply chain impact of the COVID pandemic seem like a mere hiccup in comparison. As the world’s leading trading country, the Chinese economy would be the biggest loser, but the impact would be global.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.977
,nan,"He apparently sold it due to ""Geopolitical exposure."" Let's say you think the risk of China invading Taiwan is less than 1%. It's probably still good to sell the stock, because that 1% risk of it being worth nothing isn't worth modest gains.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I don't think it is actually about ""geopolitical tensions"". ""Geopolitical tensions"" were already there and he would have considered ""geopolitical tensions"" when he first bought TSM.",1,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Buffet: rule #1: never lose money. Rule 2, always remember about rule #1.",2,0.501,POSITIVE,0.984
,nan,Not really an options play but what if tensions die down in the region. Does that make this a value buy?,0,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.918
,nan,"You may be onto something and leaps on value has been my most profitable strategy, however define ""tensions dying down"" gyna loves to stay edgy and may forever, plus chip fab may be coming home.",1,0.523,POSITIVE,0.895
,nan,Oh even better. What if they pack up shop and move production to Mexico or the states?,2,0.521,POSITIVE,0.997
,nan,"Now you're onto something, go do that DD brother",3,0.512,POSITIVE,0.909
,nan,"We all know Buffet has an inside track in Washington, just look at the oil pipelines getting shut down, so oil has to use rail , and who owns the railroads that do this- Buffet.That said I suspect he has inside info on China invading and nationalizing TSMC.China knows if it is going to do this it needs to do it while Biden is president.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.991
,nan,"Definitely ""inside info"". just like how he bought oil last year, before Russia invaded Ukraine. Now if for some reason he suddenly added defense stocks, that's your cue of a possible China invasion of Taiwan. If I recall correctly, US stated that it will aid Taiwan if it is under attack by China.",1,0.548,POSITIVE,0.912
,nan,perhaps apple may start producing its on chips rather than just the design,2,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.899
,nan,"Chips are made in fabs. Fabs cost billions of dollars and take years to build. Not to mention require a highly trained and experienced workforce. Apple could spend some serious money to build one, and hire experienced pros from other companies to run it, but I don't know why they would.",3,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.919
,nan,TMSC got lucky with EUV. Doesn’t mean it’ll always be like that. And TSM will always trade at a discount due to geopolitical risks… that’s just a fact.,4,0.5,POSITIVE,0.993
,nan,Will the geopolitical risks go down at all when they have fabs online in Arizona and Japan?,5,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.832
,nan,"And what about Foxconn? Buffet owns Apple, and that's fine, but he sells TSMC because of China problem. But Foxconn, who makes basically everything for Apple, is unaffected by the same China...Logically, he should sell Apple, too...",2,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.999

,nan,summer insurance close engine toothbrush rob truck axiomatic wrench busy,2,0.502,POSITIVE,0.799
,nan,I'm always curious what happens if the engineers who run these systems are killed or flee how they intend to run them. The level of specialization isn't something that can just be picked up when dealing with different scale chips. The systems for 9nm and 7nm processes are entirely different. I'm not saying China doesn't have people who are knowledgeable I just always feel like there is a huge amount of handwaving when it comes to the actual problems of doing this.,1,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Not even about the personal that is required but:Each machine has it’s own customised set-up. It not a plug an play system. When china invades, they will clean wipe all of them, rendering them useless. This can be done from across the seas.Trying to reverse engineer this stuff, is near impossible. Because you need a lot of testing facilities with high specifications, that are not in Taiwan.Source: Engineer in this field",2,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.772

,nan,"Not sure what china would gain from an invasion, like ok, invasion successful then what? International sanctions, all chinese ADRs get delisted, China takes over destroyed semicon fabs, worldwide boycott and condemnation. Maybe i should open some shorts on chinese ADRs",1,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,It’s not about the fabs at all to China. It’s about legacy and 1 China.Losing the chip fabs would be just a poke in the eye to everyone.,2,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.931
,nan,Oh i know that. They just want their little province back after a century of humiliation.,3,0.509,POSITIVE,0.872
