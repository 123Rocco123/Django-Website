,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense. AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. TL:DR – AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a.

They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a.

James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn.

AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips.

My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well.

,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old.

While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense. AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. TL:DR – AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon.","Intel's packaging sites are in Chengdu, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Costa Rica.

,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs.

The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense. AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well.

,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future.

I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense. AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. TL:DR – AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon.",One think I don’t like about AI talk is that every business will be saving money on labour.

And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. TL:DR – AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon.","This comment is misleading at best. AMKR's stock went parabolic at that time -- from $8 a share to $62 a share in a matter of like 8 months -- almost 700%.The current trajectory doesn't at all mirror what happened in 1999. AMKR's stock is up 15% in the last 8 months. P/E last year was only 20 despite absolutely terrible smartphone sales. In 2000 their revenue was $2bb and their valuation was nearly double what it is today. Last year, despite a down year, their earnings were 6bb -- meaning the P/E was something like 6 times higher in 2000.You would have a valid argument if AMKR's price was currently $182 a share.",1,0.595,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future. There are many reasons why I’m bullish on AMKR specifically, but I’ve outlined a few of the major reasons below. AMKR is the only US based company currently that has the ability to package CoWoS chips. The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense.

The Biden administration has repeatedly stated again and again how important it is for the US to have the ability to package chips domestically. AMKR is 55 years old. They have stood the test of time. They aren’t some brand-new start up that is entirely dependent on debt or issuing massive amounts of new shares to fund their growth. AMKR actually pays a dividend making it attractive to boomers as well. It’s dividends have also purely been covered by free cash flow – amounting to just 18% of its free cash flow last year. They have also increased this dividend by 25 % each year on average. AMKR liabilities have been decreasing every year as a percent of their assets. AMKR has a strong balance sheet, with free cash continuing to grow every year. AMKR has started development of a massive manufacturing and packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona – building a $2bb plant there that will have 500k sq ft of ‘clean room space.’ AMKR expanded their already existing partnership with Apple for Chip packaging in November. Apple has already pledged to be the first and largest customer of said plant. Through this partnership, Apple has already worked extensively on the strategic vision and manufacturing capabilities for said facility in Peoria. AMKR has applied for a grant from the Chips act to develop said facility. I believe they will get said grant. a. As I mentioned previously, they are currently the only US company with CoWoS capability. This is important to the Biden administration. b. James Joo-Jin Kim (whose family founded AMKR, and who are the largest shareholders currently), have a lot of ties to Penn. Biden has a lot of ties to Penn. While I haven’t found any direct relationship between the two, I would like to believe that if Biden has an leverage on where these grants are dispersed, AMKR is ‘likable’ in this sense. AMKR’s current market cap is only $7bb. Plenty of room for this baby to run, especially given its segment. And finally, best for last, AMKR surged in June upon rumors that NVDA was directly helping AMKR with packaging solutions for CoWoS AI Chips. Amkor 2.5D chip packaging nearly doubled from 3,000 wafers monthly in early 2023, to 5,000 by year end, and projections of 7,000 by end of 2024. 80% of these are for NVDA. That’s all I have for today. I’ve burned 1.5 hours of my work day typing this out. I am normally an “invest in the 401k,” day trade lotto plays type of guys. For the foreseeable future, I intend on acquiring more and more shares of AMKR stock, and continuing to buy Options as far out in the future as I can – currently stacking the 09/20 $35 Calls. My hope is that AMKR will get increased attention through a grant from the CHIPS act, production beginning on their new facility, an official partnership with NVDA, and reports of increased chip packaging production, leaps will open up that I can begin acquiring as well. TL:DR – AI Stocks go rocketship boooom. AMKR has yet to truly lift off. Plenty of catalysts to send it to the moon.","Example of Thesis is a blunder but confidently written . Their only job is to put to chips into devices and iots , bot putting transistors onto a chip like TSMC. This shouldn’t even be compared with TSMC damn itAMKOR might still go up but definitely not for the reason you wrote.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.587
,"Let’s face it – this AI boom isn’t going away any time soon. I say this as a guy who had decided entirely that he missed the NVDA train, then proceeded to YOLO a $700 call right before close yesterday (then panic sell it for a $2500 win, but $2300 less than I could have sold it for if I held it a mere 20 minutes longer), I’m officially convinced that AI is the next mega growth space in the market. AI requires chips. NVDA has somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the market of these GPU’s, something that doesn’t appear will be challenged in the immediate future. While many of the other major tech players have decided they are going to enter the space – this isn’t a process that happens particularly quickly, and I think it is reasonable to expect that NVDA’s dominance in this space should continue for at least the next couple of years. The US has a desperate need for independence in the semiconductor space, and AMKOR is a company that will help take us there. The pandemic was an absolute screaming example of why we need more control over the chip supply chain – as chip shortages caused supply chain debacles that brought many electronic industries to a halt (the auto industry as well). The resulting inflation created by this issue (among any other issues) was pronounced enough that Biden initiated what I believe to be the most important and prominent success of his administration thus far – the CHIPS and Science act – pledging to give something like $39 billion in grants/incentives to US based across the supply chain to bolster domestic production capabilities. Once a chip is manufactured, or at least the ones required for AI tasks, they are required to be packaged via a process called CoWoS – or Chip on Wafer on Substrate. This process is fairly complex, and there aren’t many companies worldwide that are able to package this way currently. Contrary to popular believe – the “Chips Shortgage” that we have faced in recent years isn’t actually a shortage of chips – but rather the inability to package chips using CoWoS quick enough to keep up with the absolutely insane demand. TSMC – Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company – is far and away the largest current packager for CoWoS chips (they actually manufacture NVDA chips as well, but that’s an entirely different wall of text all together. NVDA has actually built a moat of sorts around the GPU chip industry). However – there are several major problems with NVDA’s reliance on TSMC for chip packaging. TSMC cannot currently keep up with the demand. Not even close. This was reiterated by their chairman as recently as September, and he has stated it will be several years before they can keep up with the NVDA CoWoS needs. Even if TSMC could keep up with NVDA’s needs (they can’t) – there are tons of other major players entering this space that have a need for CoWoS packaging – which will further create demand for more packaging facilities. TSMC currently manufacture all almost all their chips in Taiwan. While they have agreed to new plants in Germany, Japan, China, and the United States, Taiwan’s national security considerations (and the US’ interest in this as well) mean they will likely continue to manufacture their most advanced chips in Taiwan. They’ve actually had to get approval from the US government to manufacture/package their less advanced chips at their two facilities in China. TSMC will always have the imminent threat of action that China decides to take. This is likely as big of a catalyst for the Chips Act as the supply chain shortages were. The US doesn’t want to be reliant on what China decides to do or not do in regards to Taiwan when it comes to our chips. All of these items leave a massive opportunity for new players to enter the space, and I believe AMKOR will be a major player that fills that role in the future.
