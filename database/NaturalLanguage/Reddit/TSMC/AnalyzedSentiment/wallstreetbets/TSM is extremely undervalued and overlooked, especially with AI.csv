Intel does, but only the lower end ones. TSMC produces ALL high end chips.your comparison just does not make much sense. TSMC does not develop chip architecture (not made for AI nor any other purpose). Thats Intel, AMD and NVIDIA.TSMC however ""burns"" those developed architectures of semi-conducting-lines on thin silicone wavers (in simple terms). TSMC is THE ONLY company world wide capable of producing the highest end super dense chips. They do not do so alone either. For instance they use ASML's lithography machines (again a company that is the only one world wide capable of providing these for highest end chip-production).NOBODY overlooks TSMC. Nor should TSMC be directly part of the AI hype (only indirectly through higher demand, which is already insanely high).WHY is TSMC not at 150? because it sits in Taiwan. and the second-most powerful economy in the world thinks taiwan is essentially their birthright. good time to buy in my books. but has a risk to go to 0.",0,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0

China is a major concern.You also don't understand, China's population is aging, economy is stagnating. US is developing new generations of arms but won't come online later in the decade or the next. Xi is more incentivized to act soon.Even if we assume China invades and we get another Ukraine situation. TSMC's fab will be destroyed just like Ukraine's farm lands.
