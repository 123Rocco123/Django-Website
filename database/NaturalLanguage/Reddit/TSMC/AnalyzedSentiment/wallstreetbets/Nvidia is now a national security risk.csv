,"With a market cap of 1.7 T nvidia has put itself in an unusual position. It has about 50 buildings world wide and outsourced it manufacturing. TSMC and the Chinese produce the physical chips. Thing is, if something was to happen to a manufacturing plant, natural or terroristic because the supply chain and how little redundant manufacturing they have. Any hiccup would cause a catastrophic downward spiral. They don't need more cash and that's what an insurance payout would give. They need a rock solid supply chain. The real problem is to many institutions, 401k, and life savings are heavily propped up by nvidia. This makes it a national security threat. A sell off of this magnitude or even correction is going to devastate our economy. I personally believe they need to rethink and move their manufacturing to the USA. Their margins are high enough to cover the labor cost, and it is in the instrest of the USA for them to do so. I personally sold my nvida positions and calling it a day.

As you understand, moving to the USA would reduce their margins significantly, and though they may still be profitable, they’d be less profitable, leading to a lower stock price and whatever consequences that entails.That being said, Nvidia is about 3-4% of the S&P500, so even if every plant got destroyed and the company disappeared, it’d only directly lower the benchmark S&P by 3-4%.The problem is moreso that the products it supplies, being disrupted would disrupt production down the supply chain hurting other companies, and likely leading to inflation like we saw during the most recent post-Covid supply chain crisis. This isn’t an issue Nvidia really has to care about. It’s something, we the public, and other companies have to care about. Luckily, we’d have to wait to see how effective anything is, the government is now incentivizing domestic chip making because they understand the risk you described.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0
