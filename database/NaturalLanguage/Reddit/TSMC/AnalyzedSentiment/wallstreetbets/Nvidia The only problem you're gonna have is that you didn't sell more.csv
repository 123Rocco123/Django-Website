,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio â€“ it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. ðŸ”¥ AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machineðŸ‘» Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. ðŸ“‰ Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. ðŸ’¸ Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. ðŸ˜‚ TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. ðŸ”¥ Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze.

Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. ðŸ”¥ AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency.
