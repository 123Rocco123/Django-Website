,"Monday 4/7 Fed TLDR: May hike probability jumped to 72%; But more cuts are anticipated; overall good for stocks After last Friday’s upbeat jobs report, May rate hike probability jumped to 72% however market is still pricing in 1-2 rate cuts this year. Market has been aggressively pricing in more cuts this year and next year due to downward surprises in macro-economic data (which in part fueled the recently rally). Business TLDR: US business under stress from low demand and refinancing difficulties; overall bad for stocks Tupperware down almost 50% today due to debt problem. Fast raising in Fed rate and recent tightening financial conditions (bank tightening their lending conditions) make company with high liability extremely hard to refinance Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said Monday that its revenue fell 15% in March from a year earlier, marking the first drop in nearly four years, suggesting softer than expected demand from downstream electronic companies (e.g. Apple etc). TSMC has slashed its capital spending plans for this year to a range of $32 billion to $36 billion, down from $36.3 billion last year, creating headwinds for upstream semiconductor suppliers. But the executives said that they expect the company’s sales in the first half to decline by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage in US dollar terms, but that business would pick up in the second half. Apple global PC shipments down 40.5% in Q1 yoy; Dell shipments fell 31% Economy TLDR: inflation might be stickier than most think; inflation expectation is higher again in March; however, macro-economic data suggest more pain ahead due to softer demand; stagflation incoming? Overall bad for stocks US used car price is on the rise again with auto inventory at a historical low level Used car price (wholesale) raised again in March (4 month in a roll); however important to note that sales on the retail side was down 6% yoy US auto inventory is still at a historical low levelTravel demand is still high Travel demand is solid with hotel price through the roof Travel demand is still high Hotel booking still solid with huge price jump from before the pandemic Rent increase slowing down but still increasing (prices up 0.5% MoM; 2.6% YoY) Also oil price jumped back to $80 last week Today's data showed Wholesale Inventories 0.1%, Exp. 0.2% Wholesale trade sales 0.4%, Exp. 0.6% This data is in line with the economy slowing down narrative. Similar data last week including ISM manufacturing and service, consumer spending etc. Also supported by diving trucking cost and delivery time. Inflation expectation up again due to higher used car price and gas price BoA’s michael Hartnett called market top: The $SPX rally “from 3.8k to 4.1-4.2k likely run its course; we say ‘sell the last rate hike’ on May 3rd.” Analysts expecting 7% EPS drop in Q1 and 6% drop in Q2. This month’s earnings report will be very important to determine where we are going next. My current estimations: Base case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is stickier than expected, not Fed cut by year-end. Bull case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is down without large job loss; Fed hint cutting in 2024. Bear case: earnings come in lower than expectation, however, inflation is still sticky, no Fed cut by year-end.
