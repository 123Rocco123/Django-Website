,"Background High-NA EUV lithography represents a significant leap forward in semiconductor manufacturing technology, poised to dominate over traditional EUV systems. This advanced technology employs an increased numerical aperture of 0.55, compared to 0.33 in current EUV systems, enabling the production of even smaller and more intricate features on silicon wafers. The higher numerical aperture allows for sharper imaging and improved resolution, pushing the boundaries of chip manufacturing into the angstrom era. Intel has secured a crucial first-mover advantage by acquiring ASML's entire 2024 stock of High-NA EUV machines. This strategic move includes five to six units, each valued at approximately $370 million, with the first machine already delivered and assembled at Intel's Oregon facility in early 2024. By monopolizing the initial production run of these cutting-edge tools, Intel has positioned itself at the forefront of semiconductor technology advancement. This aggressive acquisition strategy provides Intel with several key advantages: Technological leadership: Intel will be the first to integrate High-NA EUV into its manufacturing processes, potentially leapfrogging competitors in transistor density and chip performance. Process optimization: Early access allows Intel to refine its manufacturing techniques and overcome initial challenges before competitors even receive their machines. Attracting partnerships: Intel's advanced capabilities may draw high-profile customers like Microsoft and potentially Nvidia to its foundry services. Market positioning: This move could help Intel reverse its recent foundry business losses and reclaim its position as a leading semiconductor manufacturer. Ecosystem development: Intel can start building the necessary infrastructure and expertise around High-NA EUV technology, creating a significant barrier to entry for latecomers. With competitors like Samsung and SK Hynix potentially waiting until the second half of 2025 for their High-NA EUV equipment, Intel has secured a critical time advantage in the race to develop and commercialize next-generation semiconductor technologies. This head start could translate into a substantial competitive edge in the rapidly evolving chip industry, potentially reshaping the semiconductor landscape in Intel's favor. Intel lost out on this cycle of silicon because TSMC had bought up all the ASML EUV machine 5-7 years ago. Now, that Intel has secured next generation NA-EUV machines, it's in a much strong position for the next silicon cycle EUV It's important to note that while TSMC currently leads in EUV-based chip manufacturing, companies like Samsung and Intel are working hard to catch up. Intel, for example, has made significant investments in R&D and has secured early access to ASML's next-generation High NA EUV machines in an attempt to regain technological leadership. TSMC currently utilizes Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for its advanced semiconductor nodes. As of now, TSMC's most advanced node in production using EUV is the 3nm (N3) process. This node features up to 25 EUV layers, with some layers using EUV double-patterning to achieve higher logic and SRAM transistor density compared to the previous 5nm node. TSMC has also detailed its roadmap for future nodes, including the 2nm (N2) process expected around 2025, and the 1.4nm node anticipated around 2028. The 1nm node is projected to be introduced around 2031. However, these future nodes may require the adoption of High-NA EUV tools, which TSMC plans to adopt by 2030. In summary, TSMC's current EUV capabilities allow for the production of 3nm nodes, with plans to advance to smaller nodes in the coming years. NA-EUV High-NA EUV (High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography is the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing technology designed to enable the production of even smaller and more densely packed transistors on computer chips.Key points about High-NA EUV: Improved resolution: High-NA EUV increases the numerical aperture from 0.33 in current EUV systems to 0.55, allowing for sharper imaging and smaller feature sizes. Smaller transistors: It enables chipmakers to print transistors 1.7 times smaller and achieve transistor densities 2.9 times higher than current EUV systems. Anamorphic optics: High-NA EUV uses an innovative anamorphic optical design that demagnifies the pattern by 4x in one direction and 8x in the other, allowing for better resolution while maintaining compatibility with existing reticle sizes. High-NA EUV lithography offers several advantages over traditional EUV lithography, primarily in terms of resolution, process complexity, and cost-effectiveness. Here are the key reasons why High-NA EUV is considered better: Lower Edge Placement Error High-NA EUV reduces the cumulative edge placement error associated with mask splits in multi-patterning processes. This improvement leads to better alignment and higher fidelity in the final patterns, which is critical for advanced nodes. Enhanced Design Flexibility The improved imaging window of High-NA EUV allows for more complex design elements to be implemented on a single mask. This flexibility is beneficial for designing advanced semiconductor devices with intricate features. Higher Yield By reducing the number of processing steps required, High-NA EUV can improve yield.

Intel, for example, has made significant investments in R&D and has secured early access to ASML's next-generation High NA EUV machines in an attempt to regain technological leadership. TSMC currently utilizes Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for its advanced semiconductor nodes. As of now, TSMC's most advanced node in production using EUV is the 3nm (N3) process. This node features up to 25 EUV layers, with some layers using EUV double-patterning to achieve higher logic and SRAM transistor density compared to the previous 5nm node. TSMC has also detailed its roadmap for future nodes, including the 2nm (N2) process expected around 2025, and the 1.4nm node anticipated around 2028. The 1nm node is projected to be introduced around 2031. However, these future nodes may require the adoption of High-NA EUV tools, which TSMC plans to adopt by 2030. In summary, TSMC's current EUV capabilities allow for the production of 3nm nodes, with plans to advance to smaller nodes in the coming years. NA-EUV High-NA EUV (High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography is the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing technology designed to enable the production of even smaller and more densely packed transistors on computer chips.Key points about High-NA EUV: Improved resolution: High-NA EUV increases the numerical aperture from 0.33 in current EUV systems to 0.55, allowing for sharper imaging and smaller feature sizes.

Backside power distribution: This technique, which moves power distribution under the transistors, frees up more space for signal routing. This can lead to better overall chip performance and efficiency, which is essential for running complex AI models on mobile devices. Multi-die systems: Angstrom-scale processes can be combined with multi-die system designs, allowing for more specialized and efficient chips that could be optimized for AI workloads like LLMs. While angstrom-scale chips are still in development and not yet commercially available, some smartphone manufacturers are already working on incorporating LLMs into their devices. Chinese companies like Huawei and Xiaomi are reportedly integrating LLMs into their smartphones. This trend suggests that as chip technology advances, we may see more powerful and efficient processors capable of running increasingly sophisticated LLMs locally on mobile devices. Intel may be the foundry to print the chips needed for Iphone and Android LLM in 2027  ","Intel could go up or more likely stabilize if their Habana Labs acquisition finally pays off. Gaudi2 and Gaudi3 are fairly impressive for a variety of reasons compared with NVIDIA'S HGX A100 and H100/H200 servers, but they are facing an uphill battle on the software front and NVIDIA is still ahead overall, even if they were to end up failing to ramp up their B100 production next year.Intel gave up on competing in flash storage, high performance networking, and various other areas in recent years and bet on general purpose CPUs and their hypothetical fabs, and everyone with the money to do so is going to continue spend their budget on ""AI"" instead of their server chips for the foreseeable future. Their upcoming server CPU designs are not very well aligned with the short-term (2-3 years) needs of the market in my opinion. Their client CPU scandal isn't doing them any favors, either.It's really quite sad to see it happen, but they might deserve it given their arrogance. It's too bad people have to lose their jobs due to the poor decision making of their management.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"Background High-NA EUV lithography represents a significant leap forward in semiconductor manufacturing technology, poised to dominate over traditional EUV systems. This advanced technology employs an increased numerical aperture of 0.55, compared to 0.33 in current EUV systems, enabling the production of even smaller and more intricate features on silicon wafers. The higher numerical aperture allows for sharper imaging and improved resolution, pushing the boundaries of chip manufacturing into the angstrom era. Intel has secured a crucial first-mover advantage by acquiring ASML's entire 2024 stock of High-NA EUV machines. This strategic move includes five to six units, each valued at approximately $370 million, with the first machine already delivered and assembled at Intel's Oregon facility in early 2024. By monopolizing the initial production run of these cutting-edge tools, Intel has positioned itself at the forefront of semiconductor technology advancement. This aggressive acquisition strategy provides Intel with several key advantages: Technological leadership: Intel will be the first to integrate High-NA EUV into its manufacturing processes, potentially leapfrogging competitors in transistor density and chip performance. Process optimization: Early access allows Intel to refine its manufacturing techniques and overcome initial challenges before competitors even receive their machines. Attracting partnerships: Intel's advanced capabilities may draw high-profile customers like Microsoft and potentially Nvidia to its foundry services. Market positioning: This move could help Intel reverse its recent foundry business losses and reclaim its position as a leading semiconductor manufacturer. Ecosystem development: Intel can start building the necessary infrastructure and expertise around High-NA EUV technology, creating a significant barrier to entry for latecomers. With competitors like Samsung and SK Hynix potentially waiting until the second half of 2025 for their High-NA EUV equipment, Intel has secured a critical time advantage in the race to develop and commercialize next-generation semiconductor technologies. This head start could translate into a substantial competitive edge in the rapidly evolving chip industry, potentially reshaping the semiconductor landscape in Intel's favor. Intel lost out on this cycle of silicon because TSMC had bought up all the ASML EUV machine 5-7 years ago. Now, that Intel has secured next generation NA-EUV machines, it's in a much strong position for the next silicon cycle EUV It's important to note that while TSMC currently leads in EUV-based chip manufacturing, companies like Samsung and Intel are working hard to catch up. Intel, for example, has made significant investments in R&D and has secured early access to ASML's next-generation High NA EUV machines in an attempt to regain technological leadership. TSMC currently utilizes Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for its advanced semiconductor nodes. As of now, TSMC's most advanced node in production using EUV is the 3nm (N3) process. This node features up to 25 EUV layers, with some layers using EUV double-patterning to achieve higher logic and SRAM transistor density compared to the previous 5nm node. TSMC has also detailed its roadmap for future nodes, including the 2nm (N2) process expected around 2025, and the 1.4nm node anticipated around 2028. The 1nm node is projected to be introduced around 2031. However, these future nodes may require the adoption of High-NA EUV tools, which TSMC plans to adopt by 2030. In summary, TSMC's current EUV capabilities allow for the production of 3nm nodes, with plans to advance to smaller nodes in the coming years. NA-EUV High-NA EUV (High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography is the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing technology designed to enable the production of even smaller and more densely packed transistors on computer chips.Key points about High-NA EUV: Improved resolution: High-NA EUV increases the numerical aperture from 0.33 in current EUV systems to 0.55, allowing for sharper imaging and smaller feature sizes. Smaller transistors: It enables chipmakers to print transistors 1.7 times smaller and achieve transistor densities 2.9 times higher than current EUV systems. Anamorphic optics: High-NA EUV uses an innovative anamorphic optical design that demagnifies the pattern by 4x in one direction and 8x in the other, allowing for better resolution while maintaining compatibility with existing reticle sizes. High-NA EUV lithography offers several advantages over traditional EUV lithography, primarily in terms of resolution, process complexity, and cost-effectiveness. Here are the key reasons why High-NA EUV is considered better: Lower Edge Placement Error High-NA EUV reduces the cumulative edge placement error associated with mask splits in multi-patterning processes. This improvement leads to better alignment and higher fidelity in the final patterns, which is critical for advanced nodes. Enhanced Design Flexibility The improved imaging window of High-NA EUV allows for more complex design elements to be implemented on a single mask. This flexibility is beneficial for designing advanced semiconductor devices with intricate features. Higher Yield By reducing the number of processing steps required, High-NA EUV can improve yield. Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for defects to be introduced, which is essential for maintaining high production yields at advanced nodes Lower Edge Placement Error.
