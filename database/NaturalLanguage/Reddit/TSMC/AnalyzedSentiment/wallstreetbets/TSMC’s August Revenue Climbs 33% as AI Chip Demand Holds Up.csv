,nan,"I'm not involved in semiconductors, but have visited Taiwan from the US for work for over a decade. China is not going to invade Taiwan, or try a blockade. It's just not going to happen. They have so many other means at their disposal, and while they're not going to lead to reunification, they can maintain the status quo, especially as both countries' populations start to nosedive. Xi would be risking everything for really not that much gain with an invasion, and China's military is entirely untested, unlike the US which gets into wars all the time (and currently ha Ukraine testing its equipment as well).",1,nan,nan,nan
