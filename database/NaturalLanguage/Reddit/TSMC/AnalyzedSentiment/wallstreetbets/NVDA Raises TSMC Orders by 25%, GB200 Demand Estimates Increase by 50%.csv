In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC’s performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook. TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.

Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated. Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second.

According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.

In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC’s performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.

Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated. Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process.

Hurts them on price increases but helps by guaranteeing revenue commitment. They have been putting out price increase comments to test the waters and seemingly have very little resistance. Same with Apple price increases.This is about as close to a monopoly as it gets. They have about 60% market share and #2 Samsung is at 14%. For advanced chips, they have over 90% market share. That is crazy high.Fabs take many years to build too. So it’s not like NVDA can just build some fabs real quick and build chips themselves. Apple is all-in on their own design M chips so can’t see them going back to Intel any time soon.This cycle may not last forever but next 3-5 years should be incredible. They are raking in dough right now.I think everyone expects an earnings beat. I am predicting raising guidance, beat on margin and raising margin guidance due to price increases. Finally, less likely but still predicting is more capital spending acceleration AND raising dividend.We will know in just a few days. I have $185 calls. Both 7/19 and Jan 2025.

According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million.

In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC’s performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook. TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received. The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with ""the most powerful AI chip on the surface"" will open a new page in the AI industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion. Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated. Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second.
