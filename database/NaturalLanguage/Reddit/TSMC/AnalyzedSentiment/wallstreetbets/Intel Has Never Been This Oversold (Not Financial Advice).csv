,"Warren Buffet tells us to be greedy when others are fearful, and this is one of those cases in the long term. Over its entire life span, Intel has never had an RSI value on its monthly chart be this low. This brings to question, is it Intel's death? I don't think so. There are a few things we need to consider with Intel; Taiwan, x86 and RISC V, GPU, ARM chip manufacturing, and upcoming manufacturing plants. Look at the RSI (1-month chart) Taiwan As you may know, tensions between the US, China, and Taiwan are rising, bringing a considerable risk for TSMC. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, TSMC's business will get limited by the US government. Companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm use TSMC for chip manufacturing. If the US stops dealing with TSMC, they will increase their spending on local chip manufacturing, and most of the G7, G8, and G20 will follow. X86 and RISC V Intel knows x86 is dying, so they've been looking for a new solution. ARM is not entirely out of the question, but it also uses an aging process. Though ARM is more energy efficient, it has its security flaws. Intel is investing a lot of money and time into RISC V as a new CPU architecture. While not supported by Windows yet, there have been many improvements in the space, and RISC V could be a threat to ARM in the future. GPU Intel is starting to make GPUs available to the public. The first generation may not be their best work, and there will be things to work out, but the room for growth is massive, and with their in-house chip manufacturing, they could bring manufacturing costs down and seriously compete with Nvidia and AMD. ARM Chip Manufacturing In 2023, Intel will be manufacturing and shipping ARM chips for other companies, expanding their sales and chip process domains. This will allow Intel to dip their toes in ARM chips and allow them to profit from the situation in Taiwan. If Nvidia, AMD, and Apple can't use TSMC, they will have to reach out to Intel for more chips. Upcoming Manufacturing Plants The US government recognizes they can't use TSMC if China takes over Taiwan (which is mainly why they would go to war) and therefore wants to increase chip manufacturing on US soil. They will invest in Intel. They are planning to make more facilities soon which are super expensive. Though Intel is struggling in the short-term, in the long-term these things will work out. The R&D is very intense with this company, and Pat Gelsinger knows it. Once things happen in Taiwan, Intel knows it'll be on a path of tremendous growth. It just needs to sit on the sidelines for a little before the next wave of computing comes to the market. You also can't forget they have the majority of CPU sales in PCs even with AMD putting up a serious fight. What are your thoughts?",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

X86 and RISC V Intel knows x86 is dying, so they've been looking for a new solution. ARM is not entirely out of the question, but it also uses an aging process. Though ARM is more energy efficient, it has its security flaws. Intel is investing a lot of money and time into RISC V as a new CPU architecture.

The first generation may not be their best work, and there will be things to work out, but the room for growth is massive, and with their in-house chip manufacturing, they could bring manufacturing costs down and seriously compete with Nvidia and AMD. ARM Chip Manufacturing In 2023, Intel will be manufacturing and shipping ARM chips for other companies, expanding their sales and chip process domains.

,"Warren Buffet tells us to be greedy when others are fearful, and this is one of those cases in the long term. Over its entire life span, Intel has never had an RSI value on its monthly chart be this low. This brings to question, is it Intel's death? I don't think so. There are a few things we need to consider with Intel; Taiwan, x86 and RISC V, GPU, ARM chip manufacturing, and upcoming manufacturing plants. Look at the RSI (1-month chart) Taiwan As you may know, tensions between the US, China, and Taiwan are rising, bringing a considerable risk for TSMC. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, TSMC's business will get limited by the US government. Companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm use TSMC for chip manufacturing. If the US stops dealing with TSMC, they will increase their spending on local chip manufacturing, and most of the G7, G8, and G20 will follow. X86 and RISC V Intel knows x86 is dying, so they've been looking for a new solution. ARM is not entirely out of the question, but it also uses an aging process. Though ARM is more energy efficient, it has its security flaws. Intel is investing a lot of money and time into RISC V as a new CPU architecture. While not supported by Windows yet, there have been many improvements in the space, and RISC V could be a threat to ARM in the future. GPU Intel is starting to make GPUs available to the public. The first generation may not be their best work, and there will be things to work out, but the room for growth is massive, and with their in-house chip manufacturing, they could bring manufacturing costs down and seriously compete with Nvidia and AMD. ARM Chip Manufacturing In 2023, Intel will be manufacturing and shipping ARM chips for other companies, expanding their sales and chip process domains. This will allow Intel to dip their toes in ARM chips and allow them to profit from the situation in Taiwan. If Nvidia, AMD, and Apple can't use TSMC, they will have to reach out to Intel for more chips. Upcoming Manufacturing Plants The US government recognizes they can't use TSMC if China takes over Taiwan (which is mainly why they would go to war) and therefore wants to increase chip manufacturing on US soil. They will invest in Intel. They are planning to make more facilities soon which are super expensive. Though Intel is struggling in the short-term, in the long-term these things will work out. The R&D is very intense with this company, and Pat Gelsinger knows it. Once things happen in Taiwan, Intel knows it'll be on a path of tremendous growth.

There are a few things we need to consider with Intel; Taiwan, x86 and RISC V, GPU, ARM chip manufacturing, and upcoming manufacturing plants. Look at the RSI (1-month chart) Taiwan As you may know, tensions between the US, China, and Taiwan are rising, bringing a considerable risk for TSMC. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, TSMC's business will get limited by the US government. Companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm use TSMC for chip manufacturing. If the US stops dealing with TSMC, they will increase their spending on local chip manufacturing, and most of the G7, G8, and G20 will follow. X86 and RISC V Intel knows x86 is dying, so they've been looking for a new solution. ARM is not entirely out of the question, but it also uses an aging process. Though ARM is more energy efficient, it has its security flaws. Intel is investing a lot of money and time into RISC V as a new CPU architecture. While not supported by Windows yet, there have been many improvements in the space, and RISC V could be a threat to ARM in the future. GPU Intel is starting to make GPUs available to the public. The first generation may not be their best work, and there will be things to work out, but the room for growth is massive, and with their in-house chip manufacturing, they could bring manufacturing costs down and seriously compete with Nvidia and AMD. ARM Chip Manufacturing In 2023, Intel will be manufacturing and shipping ARM chips for other companies, expanding their sales and chip process domains. This will allow Intel to dip their toes in ARM chips and allow them to profit from the situation in Taiwan. If Nvidia, AMD, and Apple can't use TSMC, they will have to reach out to Intel for more chips. Upcoming Manufacturing Plants The US government recognizes they can't use TSMC if China takes over Taiwan (which is mainly why they would go to war) and therefore wants to increase chip manufacturing on US soil. They will invest in Intel. They are planning to make more facilities soon which are super expensive. Though Intel is struggling in the short-term, in the long-term these things will work out. The R&D is very intense with this company, and Pat Gelsinger knows it. Once things happen in Taiwan, Intel knows it'll be on a path of tremendous growth.

The only problem with your DD as far as TSMC is: they are investing over 100 billion in Phoenix AZ building one of the world largest chip plants.

Intel currently does not have said capability. And Nancy Pelosi was just there visiting her husbands money, he is heavily invested:) .
