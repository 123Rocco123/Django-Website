,"I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation. Growth Investment vs. Value Investment.   One one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their “valuations” will be justified by NVDA’s performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be.  When the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere.  On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a “reality check”, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won’t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December.  The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.  Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014.   That is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL).  We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:  How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy’s growth?  To be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion.  What is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don’t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.

,"I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation. Growth Investment vs. Value Investment.   One one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their “valuations” will be justified by NVDA’s performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be.  When the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere.  On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a “reality check”, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won’t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December.  The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.  Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014.   That is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL).  We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:  How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy’s growth?  To be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion.  What is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don’t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.

On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a “reality check”, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won’t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum.

It's as simple as that no reason to bring falsehood into this as value stocks can also have way higher PE and growth stocks can have relatively low PE.

What exactly screams confidence of Adam Smith to you? I'm not even close to raging. What?",2,nan,nan,nan
,"I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation. Growth Investment vs. Value Investment.   One one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their “valuations” will be justified by NVDA’s performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be.  When the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere.  On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a “reality check”, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won’t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December.  The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.  Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014.   That is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL).  We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:  How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy’s growth?  To be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion.  What is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don’t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.

Are my puts fucked?","NVDA is not apple and people that compare the two are clowns.Apple makes computers, phones and sells video games and music.Nvidia keeps computers and servers going.
