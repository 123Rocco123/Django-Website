TSMC exports was the place to start looking! Did you listen and save money?Hardware needs to be backed up by software earnings from the end consumer. Otherwise it’s just big business shelling money onto another big business, (hoping that with more hardware and software eventually people will buy more products and/or services from them in turn), essentially just an upgrade CYCLE!We are nowhere near any application for AI that regular people actually need to or WILL fork out money for and the other thing you might start to notice is that AI that can program just replaces programmers creating right now simply more unemployment to the already scared shirtless unemployment data that was just released. Essentially the programmers building the software gets replaced by said software in full on irony!Anyway if you create more margins by less employment in the end the economy just backfires as employment is the damn backbone of consumption!AI (in the form that we probably can’t obtain) essentially would lead to mass unemployment, bigger gains for a few companies at first, then serious social issues, money printing for stimulus and citizen salaries, in essence destroying the backbone of capitalism which is paid work leading to social revolution and straight up Marxism!
