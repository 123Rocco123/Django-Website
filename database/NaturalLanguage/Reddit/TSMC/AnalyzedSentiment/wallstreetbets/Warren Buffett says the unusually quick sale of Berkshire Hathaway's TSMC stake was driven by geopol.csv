,nan,Buffet bought the “China invades Taiwan” meme…Not a good sign for the whale.,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,I might have details hazy but didn't the US started building the semi conduct factory inside the US?The capital outflow from Asian investors from US/Canada was happening for the past 9 months so Buffet is not the only one who is buying into that meme.China wouldn't want Taiwan without TSMC. The US wouldn't care about Taiwan as much once local TSMC factory is operational,1,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"China wouldn't want Taiwan without TSMCThis is so wrong.Taiwan is of massive strategic importance to China, Just look at the map and do some reading around the South China sea conflict. If Malaysia shuts down the Strait of Malacca then the bulk of their oil has to come via the Pacific Ocean past Taiwan which is a real problem if they don't control it.Imagine China and Russia having forward operating air and naval bases in Hawaii to understand this. They are not about to risk WWIII just for a semi fab plant. They want and need the Taiwan land to mitigate a major strategic threat not to mention how this strengthens their case for controlling yet more area of the South China Sea.",2,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.989

,nan,"No they’re bad at it, wrote themselves into a corner militarily and diplomatically. Should’ve had nukes (they tried, gave up coz Uncle Sam stopped them twice, should’ve said fuck it), fixed conscription years ago and built more on anti-China sentiment, they did a bad job during the Cold War.",4,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.994

,nan,"Buffet is completely connected to the DC insider world so he's probably been explicitly told ""Taiwan is going to fold if/when China invades and China will have the capacity to do so in 5-10 years""US is pulling out of Taiwan mainly because Taiwan itself doesn't look like they will resist a military invasion.",2,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.999

,nan,"For now, yes.The problem the US faces is that some of the steps that are necessary to prepare for possible defeat of Taiwan (in 10+ years), eg CHIPS act, are going to telegraph exactly that we are preparing for the possible necessity of abandoning Taiwan.",4,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"Or maybe the US is just suring up domestic supply of something that's basically critical infrastructure at this point because strategy is multifaceted and you don't risk your entire access to something based on a situation that can go in different directions, and you're just a big weeble wobble idiot on the internet, huh?

,nan,"the US is (to my eye) preparing to bail on Taiwan. As well as preparing to defend it. If there is ever a military conflict over Taiwan (I think this is less likely than not), how much of a fight the US puts up depends on how much of a fight Taiwan is willing to put up.Until recently, it has been tacitly assumed that Taiwan would vigorously resist.What I'm trying to say is that the US is preparing for contingencies that it has not historically prepared for.",4,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.976

,nan,"And US is building better fabs than Taiwan right now. Once they are up and running US Military strategy will be to stop anyone else from getting any tech that's ahead of INTEL. Which makes INTC the safest and therefore most boring investment in the world right now. They are going to 1 trillion mc in the next 5 years, unless someone conquers America (not gonna happen).Buffett got into TSMC because the industry is going to keep expanding over the decade, but got out quick because TSMC itself is about to get wrecked. This leaves INTEL as the worlds dominant chip manufacturer sometime around 2024. They already have priority service agreements with ASML. How much more evidence do people need?",3,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.864

,nan,"Taiwan is way more likely to buckle the way Hong Kong did(""One country, two systems"") than the way Ukraine has.

,nan,"China is unlikely to do anything as drastic as an actual invasion this year. In 5 years possibly, 10 years likely, but not now. Their Navy isn’t ready for that kind of conflict. It would be an amphibious landing about 1.25-1.5 times the size of D Day and expecting the US Navy as well as Taiwans military to just let it happen.We might see China try to blockade or exert pressure through the market but highly unlikely an actual invasion is in the cards within the next year. I am also betting that China will wait for TSMCs Arizona fab to be fully online before invading as well so that the US is less likely to intervene. If they invade before that happens the US really doesn’t have much of a choice but to get involved or become irrelevant on the world stage.",2,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

Also biden has repeatedly done the oppsite of what you claimWASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, his most explicit statement on the issue, drawing an angry response from China that said it sent the wrong signal to those seeking an independent Taiwan.Sep 19, 2022that said, if there is a war, or if china takes taiwan unopposed by the US, i have a feeling we will see huge disruptions in the IC market for obvious fucking reasons",4,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.995

,nan,"I guess possible but Taiwan is a strong democracy and reunification with China has been less and less popular every year for awhile now. Also they have the world market by the balls due to their advanced chip fabs.Additionally, the US has being the doing the exact opposite of what you claim recently. That is what the visit by Pelosi was about as well as the recent meetings Taiwan had with senior members of the legislature last month. The current administration is engaging more heavily with Taiwan as a signal to China of increased support. Biden has also been far tougher on Russia than either Trump or Obama.We will likely have to agree to disagree but I think your personal politics are blinding you to what is actually happening. I did make a large bet on TSMC last year when they hit mid 60s and am still holding (20k in shares and 5k in 2024Jan 80c LEAPS) so I am a bit biased as well.",5,0.546,NEGATIVE,1.0
