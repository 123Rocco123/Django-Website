Has something changed?","The bull case for Intel vs. bear case for AMD (CPUs)Until recently, Intel and AMD were the only 2 companies allowed to design x86 processors for intellectual property reasons. These are the main types of CPUs used in PCs and servers, not like the less powerful but more energy efficient ARM chips used in mobile devices and some laptops.Intel manufactured their own and AMD had theirs manufactured by TSMC. TSMC had superior manufacturing technology to Intel because they were highly subsidized by the Taiwanese government and had first mover advantage adopting the last generation of EUV tech, so AMD's chips were better. But the performance gap is pretty much entirely due to TSMC's superior fab tech and should not be priced into AMD's stock.So, what has changed? Intel replaced the CEO with an engineer with a new strategy. He is turning Intel into a fab for hire to compete with TSMC and he is doing it on the American taxpayer's dime thanks to the CHIPS act. They are leading the charge on the transition to high NA EUV fab technology, which will either turn out to be a blunder OR will give them a hige advantage over TSMC depending on their yields. What's more, Intel has said that they will open up some of their proprietary IP to companies that want to use their fab, meaning potentially anybody could design their own x86 CPUd. AMD is no longer part of a duopoly where they have an unfair competive advantage in design thanks to their x86 license and an unfair competitive advantage in manufacturing thanks to artificially cheap and subsidized advanced TSMC manufacturing. They are now 1 of a million companies able to design x86 on the 2nd tier fab tech with what little capacity is left after NVDA and AAPL get their fill.",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.918

People don’t see it now, but once TSMC gets overwhelmed with orders from NVIDIA or there’s a backlog and they can’t meet demands I can see these companies turning to INTEL for manufacturing here in the states. Also, if Trump gets the elected China-Us relations may impact trade and investments in Taiwan. So exports may be risky.",1,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.999

BK clearing out all possible CEO successors and wanting to be unchallenged CEO of the company. This led to a vaccum of leadership.they massively undersold themselves with the nonsensical mode numberings that most semiconductor companies are marketing. Most folks are out of their depth when it comes to semiconductor process technology. So when they hear TSMC has come out with 5nm and Intel is at 7nm they think wow INTC is soo far behind.I would even go on to argue that INTC process and TSMC processes are close to parity. The real reason TSMC is favored by almost every company out there is the ease of use of the PDK. TSMC adapted all their PDKs and library offerings for their customers. Intel was stubborn and expected the industry to mend their ways and learn Intels ways of working. Which was absolutely foolish.The embarrassment of 10nm process node. Intel could have just abandoned this node and still been in the same position.it’s lazy to say that Intel stopped innovating, Intel leads the way in packaging and with other innovations such as PowerVia. I would go on to argue TSMC hasn’t innovated anything really just kept itself abreast of whatever Intel has done but done it better cause they barely take any technological risks. TSMC always play it safe waiting for Samsung and Intel to sink their cash.Now that Pat is at the helm I’m sure he’s weeding out all these mis steps, firstly renaming the nodes was an important one. Pat is unique cause he’s an engineer who’s a master marketer. Intel has lost the marketing war for the last few decades having CEOs who are finance guys or non technical guys.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0
