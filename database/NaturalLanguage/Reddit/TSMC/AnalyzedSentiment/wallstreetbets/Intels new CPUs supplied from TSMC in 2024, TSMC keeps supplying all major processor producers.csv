,nan,"Intel presented their Lunar Lake processors on the Computex Event annoucing that TSMC will mass produce them by the second semester of this year. Source:https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240617PD217.htmlTSMC is now again supplying NVIDIA, Apple and Intel, therefore the 3 major players in todays generation of Computing & Processing. They have a monopoly on the by far biggest market of the future according to Stephen Schwarzmann, CEO of Blackstone (source: Handelsblatt Interview)Regardless shares this morning were down ~2% ",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.59
,nan,The stock is extremely sensitive to tensions in the south China sea. The 2 % drop is most likely due to clashes between Filipino and Chinese sailors escalating.,1,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.998

,nan,"It was actually bolas, bats, knives, axes and spears. It's the same shit with India from last year, China is abusing grey zones via using bladed and blunt weapons instead of guns. Since usage of guns would be considered an act of aggression, which means both US and Japan can respond because of the defense treaty they have with Philippines.",3,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"China had made shit tons of enemies in a short 5 years, I won't be surprised if China eventually tries to invade Taiwan and everyone responds by attacking China from all sides.",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.939
,nan,"Old news, Gelsinger already announced it at Computex 2 weeks ago. Also not surprising considering after all the gaslighting, INTC gave up and said they have no idea why 14th Gen CPUs kept crashing at everything from heavy workload(compiling, rendering, etc) to gaming. They'll rely on TSMC to continue generating revenue with their CPUs while doing their refineries from the ground up again.In other news, INTC bagholders' bags just got extra heavy",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,2 weeks ago?That was known for months easily,1,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"Rumors that Lunar Lake was going to be developed by TSMC were known for months, but the confirmation only came when Gelsinger announced it at Computex.The rumors was what caused the dump in February btw, I still remember when INTC bagholders said ""it was fake news"" because ""why would a company with their own foundries outsource their chip making to another foundries and a direct competitor at that?!""Aged like milk :4271:",2,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"BullshitI even found interview from 2022 which has image with their roadmap and they are very clear about external foundryhttps://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger/The rumors was what caused the dump in February btw,There was no dump in feb and dump in january was caused by weak guidance",3,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,A bug in the micro code will be there regardless of who builds the chips.,1,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"You don't say, but that's pure cope reasoning considering INTC is the only one that has that specific problem right now with their latest chip but no answer to fix it. The whole bull case about INTC is government backing their foundries, and said foundries succeeding. Gelsinger said he bet the entire company on 18A, yet now he came out and say their next gen would be fully made by a direct competitor in the foundry business. But hey, keep coping.",2,0.565,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Their next gen processor is made on TSMCs 3nm node. Next year Intels 1.8nm node will be available for high volume. TSMC won’t even have a comparable node for over a year, meanwhile Intel is already working on 1.4nm node using high-NA EUV which TSMC said they didn’t need, but are now walking back and beginning to look at the next gen litho tools. But if you want to keep the TSMC bubble going have at it. While you are doing your analysis, overly the TSMC chart over a typical bubble chart.",3,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Stop changing the subject whenever the facts doesn't fit your biases you regarded INTC bagholder, I don't even hold any stocks nor options in TSMC. Ah yes surely that's gonna happen despite 12 years worth of empty promises and gaslighting right? You regards are on the same level as gamecock bagholders. Keep moving the goalpost alright.",4,0.51,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Intel is on a new path. If you don’t recognize that, well I’m not surprised for a user with NVDA in their name. I’m sure you are totally unbiased and rational.",5,0.542,POSITIVE,0.984
,nan,"Ironic coming from an INTC bagholder. I work in cybersecurity and regularly deal with documentation, testing, approval and managing deployments of both office computers and workstations. That means I regularly get in contact with both OEMs and the big 3 companies themselves. Without breaking NDA, there's a reason I keep making fun of you absolute regarded bagholders who kept parroting the same fucking 3 talking points(foundries, self-sustain, TSMC killer) for the past 12 years. Also you talk as if holding NVDA is a bad thing, assuming you held INTC stocks and leaps as long as I held my NVDA, I'm up 3,350.66% while you're down 35%.But like I said, keep coping. Reminder that one day when you let go of your ego and finally admit you're a fucking moron for believing in INTC, you made the choice to be poor and have negative returns.",6,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.953
,nan,Something something irrational exuberance… one stock is beaten down with an upcoming process node that none of their competitors can compete with. The other almost completely mimics the stereotypical bubble. Gee I wonder who I will invest in.,0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.984
,nan,And there's your Copilot+ power without need for NVDA GPU integration. AI locally run on low power machines without need for cloud access. Intel poosh big.,0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.998

,nan,"Imagine paying a $20B mortgage on your own fabs, then having to hire a 3rd party manufacturer because those fabs don't work. Eternal puts on INTC.",0,0.504,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,The fabs are not up yet when they designed this chip.,1,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.686
,nan,They're still paying on their fabs in Portland and Phoenix that are loaded with 14nm+++++ and 10nm junk.,2,0.504,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,This is how I know you don’t know anything about what intel fabs currently doing.,3,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"If it's Intel 5, Intel 3, I really don't care. If it was anything competitive, they wouldn't be subcontracting.They've got leading-edge amounts of capital sunk into machines that can't manufacture viable products, so they have to pay even more capital to their competitors just to get something on the shelf. It's a hell of a business model.",4,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,Thin and low power notebooks.And very likely handhelds like the one from ASUS.,1,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Typically CPUs are using in computers.But seriously these are high end server chips that usually get sold as part of a whole rack setup.,1,0.516,POSITIVE,0.934
,nan,"This is cool and all, but only up to 8 cores? Seriously? Even Arrow Lake has a disappointing amount of cores.It’s like Intel forgot that the HPC/WS community exist. Give me 32 cores!",0,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Arrow Lake has i think 24 cores.Maybe next gen they will give you the 32 cores.,1,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.983
