,nan,And yet it still can't get traction in pre market. It's almost like someone's snorting the ELF out of this stock for some reason.,0,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I must admit I don’t get this stock.It might be the most important company in the world because if China wants to take Taiwan the US is willing to start WW3.Without it does Apple have enough chips, NVDA, AMD, MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOG etc have enough chips? The majority of AI seems to be on the back of what this company makes. Yet there’s 4 comments and it seemingly blew out earnings? (Maybe just not enough of a blowout)But it seems the west is willing to start ww3 over this company for its computing and AI production and it barely moves. Owned this for a long time and my AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN just blows my TSMC positions.Maybe I’m just salty it hasn’t kept pace with the ultra high flyers. Did it even go up $1 after earnings today?",0,0.571,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,It dropped hard today lets see what happens this friday,1,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.979
