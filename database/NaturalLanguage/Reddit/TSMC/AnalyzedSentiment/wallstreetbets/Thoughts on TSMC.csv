,"TSMC Joins Hands with Apple and Sony to Keep Samsung in Check Does anyone have pretty high predictions for TSMC? After the awful earnings from Intel a couple days ago highlighted there problems to make advanced chips and now TSMC having very sizable partners such as Apple, AMD, SONY, Buffet investing large sums and various others as well building fabs in countries outside Taiwan that thereâ€™s nothing but solid news for TSMC? I personally feels itâ€™s quite undervalued for the amount of the chip market they control and while China may remain a threat, that conflicts is a couple years off for estimates. Chip demand may remain pretty low but if itâ€™s supposed to makeup in the next couple months very well could see it takeoff. Iâ€™ve started to dump and felt like itâ€™s been a pretty solid investment over the past month. Especially with how much TSMC contributes to the advanced chip market they seem like with fabs being built itâ€™s only an amount of time before they take off. Feels like it could be pumped quite well since itâ€™s not an insanely high priced stocked and has relatively solid macro and social factors going into the company. I bought around 25 shares at 80 probably shouldâ€™ve bought more. Point being I think the components that are going into a PC or technological product are just as important as the product itself. So NVDA and Apple and others for example without the chips would be no where. ðŸš€ðŸš€",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

They will sit on surplus inventory and stall new tech rollout until the old stuff clears.AZ factory going to cost billions +billions more to operate because of high wages in US. They won't eat the costs.I mean, i think its a good deal around 60-80 and chances are we will revisit those levels.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

GM and Lear just posted some great earnings and Lear got a contract from GM for EV batter cables big enough that Lear is opening 2 more plants in Michigan and 1 in Marraco. GM is going long on EVs and as long as the China-Taiwan thing doesn't get crazy escalated then GM will continue buying from TSMC long term bullish.,0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.94

Why I took my gains and left is the China/Taiwan conflict. USA wonâ€™t intervene while fighting a proxy war with Russia, AKA US doesnâ€™t want to make the other superpowers allies of necessity. Btw, they plan on building a couple fabs in Arizona. Their are some pros and cons to this. Proâ€™s: more manufacturing and easier to collaborate with USA companies. Cons: will be seen negatively by China and; US workforce may have difficulty producing at the same level of efficiency as the Taiwanese branch bringing down the average return ROI.",0,0.532,POSITIVE,0.84
