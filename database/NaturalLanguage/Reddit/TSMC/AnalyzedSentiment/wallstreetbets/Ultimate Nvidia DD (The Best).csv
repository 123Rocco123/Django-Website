,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

The market will grow and differentiate at the same time - and NVDA will still remain the premium, gold standard supplier for datacenter AI solutions for the same reason Apple maintained their dominance along windows and androids/blackberry.You need to consider the internal philosophies of companies - a company that needs to twist and turn to get with the new thing is fundamentally behind the company which got there first by following an unchanging guiding light.The same reason Google sucks at bringing products to market is the same reason Google was never going to lead this evolution. The same reason AMD is the cheap supplier for firms looking to do more of the leg work to save money (console sales, where margin is already negative so NVDA premiums are a non starter), is the same reason OpenAI chose NVDA gpus to usher in the new Era (Rapid AI development, where time is already limited so AMD headaches are a non-starter). And the same reason Apple was the first to really make bespoke silicon for bespoke products is the same reason they'll never be in the B2B AI datacenter space (despite having the stack and expertise to go punch for punch with NVDA)I agree with most of what you have here, just some flipping some of the yes/no conclusions you came to.The NVDA software experience (which was not free to develop, and is a large part of the premium in their products) is exactly the reason firms like Automotove OEMs are going to go with NVDA chips+Omniverse instead of something else like AMD or something later like {insert future product here}.There is enough market and growth here for everyone who can even consider playing.",0,0.551,POSITIVE,0.943

This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.

Let's say MSFT designs a badass chip tomorrow, who the heck is going to make these chips? Almost all fab capacity is currently under contract. TSMC is spending $100 Billion to build fabs (in Taiwan and Arizona) just to match current demand, let alone future expansion.Let me guess, Google/META are gonna build their own fabs? Sure, it takes billions and 5-10 years. And by the time you're done, you're 2 generations behind everyone else. Call up ASML and ask them to send you an EUV real quick. What's that? 2 years backordered - and that's after the China ban.This is why AMD switched to TSMC from Global Foundries. They kept thinking they could catch up with Intel by making their own chips, and almost went bankrupt a dozen times trying. It's the same reason why new airlines don't just pop up every day. You have to spend 10s of billions to buy airplanes, get every airport in the world to give you access, work with countless countries regulators, and then hope you aren't broke so you can start doing business. The barriers to entry are astronomical.With respect to Apple, they were just making a video rendering chip - something companies have been doing for ages. Something that is included on most motherboards for free. Apple has a completely closed ecosystem and that's why they wanted control of the video process. This is also why AAPL doesn't have to worry about CUDA. They know every developer will adopt their software, because that is where the money is. Apple has 2 billion users that actually have money. What can google force customers to adopt? Android - The device used my the poors? lawl.And it's good to remember, Apple has ~12,000 Engineers and has more money than God. They can afford to play the long game. Google/Meta stopped hiring engineers and mostly hire kids that want to live in an adult day-camp...and of course, influencers. Both companies have been laying off people/cutting costs because they are bleeding money. You think they are in a position to take on a new project like build a fab or create a brand new AI GPU. Something NVDA has spent 30 years and 100s of Billions of $s researching?I can give you another 100 reasons why you are completely wrong, but I gotta drive my daughter to gymnastics.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0

You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.

Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat. So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel. Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD? This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design. Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs.

They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough. AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips. Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again. According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips. Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?! Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so: „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration. Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

,"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens. It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark. No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space. First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently? You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood. It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT. AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks. How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype? Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody. An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand. This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story). This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW. They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party. How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else. Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts: - Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees - Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to) - Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development) - Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers The Analogy: „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood). TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees. The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break. At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture. Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees. Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market. What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process. Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“ ---- NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips. Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture. NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them. Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC. TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple. So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them. There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.
