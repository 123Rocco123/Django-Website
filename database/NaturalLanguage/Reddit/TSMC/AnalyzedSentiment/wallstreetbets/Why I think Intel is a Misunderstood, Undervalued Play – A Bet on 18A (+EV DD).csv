,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan

Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight.

,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad.

Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",In Nana we trust,0,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion.

Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.","You're betting your house on a book after only reading the summary on the back cover. The rot is deep, and it takes more than a few upsides to change its fortunes. 18A and all other things are GREAT strategies, and this is not the first time Intel made good strategies on paper. The problem with Intel in the last 10 yrs has been EXECUTION. You have not mention that in your thesis. The rot prevents execution and for all the best strategies in the world, unless it is carried out on-time and with managed costs, Intel will falter like the past decade.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems.

I'm not saying this stock will definitely go up, but I think the chance of a turnaround is mispriced. On average, this play could be profitable. Of course, I can’t go into too much detail in a WSB post. It’s not about predicting exactly what will happen; anyone who claims they can predict the stock market is probably just kidding themselves.

They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.","I've actually put together a detailed 53-page analysis on Intel, but I can't share it here. Trust me, there's a lot more depth to the story than what it might seem. From the impact of their new Lunar Lake architecture to their long-term strategies in the semiconductor market, there's plenty to discuss.",3,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach.

The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",,7,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever.

We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.","I would like to see the analysis but with numbers. Please don't make it 53 pages. Just make it a story on how they could succeed. I can't read more than say 4 pages large font with pictures and graphs.Just to clarify, you are saying that Intel could succeed on 18A and then somehow that would make their chips better than AMD's and where could we see the reviews on that? Also if Intel succeeds on 18A, would they manufacture for Nvidia and AMD or would they try to take the market share?",4,nan,nan,nan

I agree with all you posted above but I would counter you on one thing. I don’t think INTC would ever go to $10, even in worst case scenario.In my DD, absolute worst case scenario is 18A/Fab is a failure. Pat gets some cans of gasoline and just burns down all of the Arizona & Ohio plants. Doesn’t even bother to sell off the high NA machines.You’re left with Intel Products, solely using TSMC, which is earning an annual operating profit of $10Bn/yr. PE ratio goes to ~5.

They cannot be the leader, they are in the US and labor law matters here, shooting margin lower and TSMC is just too far ahead and will not make the same mistake as they did. D) lunar lake looks promising, its really giving ARM a run for their money.Bear case: A) Shitty management - the board and the ceos in the past decade, have been assholes. They just missed each leap that the world has taken in semis. You can miss one turn and that's acceptable. But if you miss all of them, it's cultural. They did not have and still don't have any answer to the competition - AMD, Nvidia, TSMC. They simply cannot be trusted. They haven't done anything to earn the trust of the investors. They ran a company that lost market share to AMD that was close to bankruptcy and still are. There are too many leadership issues- this is well known and public domain news. This can be fixed but it's gonna take a really long time.B) the bet is too big - they are trying dual front - PC design and at the same time manufacturing. Manufacturing is tough and it's a big deal, you have to actually make th chip and not just design a chip and bail out. So far, yet to hear good news on 18 A status. Betting a company does not mean anything if you can't get the products to customers. The world simply don't give a fuck.C) Lunar lake manufacturing - Lunar lake was not manufactured at Intel. It was made using TSMC 3 NM process.If you are thinking about a 10 year horizon, there are better ways to make money,. If you keep your eyes open, keep shuffling your portfolio and don't take crazy bets you can still make returns that will be far better than INTC.I simply don't trust these guys. They fucked up and will fuck up again. It's just in their blood now and they are just too stubborn to admit that.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.","I see the biggest opportunities when the entire market has a solid opinion about something. That's where you can find prices that are irrational or mispriced. It doesn’t mean going against the crowd is always a winning strategy, but if you just follow what every retail trader is doing, you won't get great returns. For those looking to play it safe, ETFs like the S&P 500, QQQ, or MSCI World make a lot of sense and can provide decent returns.When I think about the next 10 years, I'm not too sure what will happen. I'm more focused on the next 1-3 years. Sure, you can jump on the NVIDIA train and the whole AI hype, but while AI is a hot topic right now, we've seen four waves of AI before, each bringing new revolutionary advancements. I’m skeptical about how “smart” these LLMs really are, and there are many other forms of AI that have potential too. Additionally, NVIDIA's valuation is influenced by factors like demand for gaming GPUs, data center growth, and the overall semiconductor market trends. However, with a $3 trillion market cap, I'm curious to see if they can maintain that level. It seems heavily tied to momentum and hype, and we all know hype can fizzle out.If you're looking to play it safe over the next year, maybe consider investing in a few broad and diversified ETFs, and perhaps look into some China and India indexes, too. Overall, I think investing in Intel could be a good addition to your portfolio, but I wouldn’t recommend putting your entire portfolio into it.",1,nan,nan,nan

,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in.

We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",Impressively stupid,0,nan,nan,nan

Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",Here for grandma jokes ...,0,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up.

In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking.

,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value.

Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.","I get the differences between Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD, and thanks for sharing your thoughts! Just to clarify, Intel mainly makes CPUs, while AMD does both CPUs and GPUs. What really grabs my attention is how NVIDIA leads in AI and innovation, which affects the whole semiconductor industry. They’re a great example of how a company’s market cap can be way different from its net assets. Even though Intel isn’t focusing on GPUs, they’re working on improved integrated graphics in their newer chips, so I’m looking at how all this plays into Intel’s situation.",2,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems.

We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",Is your nana alive?,0,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets.

But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight.

So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight.

,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now.

If they hadn’t, they’d be on a slow path to decline and, eventually, failure.Second, it’s not only about whether Intel gets help or not. They’re making strides on their own.

But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.","I hope you're right, I'm not one of those who takes pleasure in a good company gone bad. But their track record is shit. They went from industry leader to repeat laughingstock in 10 years. I know a lot of Bay Area engineers and none would touch a job at Intel for any amount of money - it'd be career suicide for them. The deck is stacked against them. Their valuation may be ""book"" - look up goodwill if you want to see what's written in the book - but they are priced at book value for a company that was expected to be an industry leader in about 10 different areas. Their future plans don't include industry leadership in any area and they are exiting more than half of the markets they've been working in (and borrowing money to do $XX billion capex in.)It's no joke to spend $20B on capex in the hope of entering a market, and then exit that market. It's no joke to do that in 5 different markets in 10 years. It's no joke to put out a quarterly report showing you lost $9 billion in 3 months, after your turnaround was supposed to have been under way for a year and a half. As an investor you have the option to invest in other companies, ones that don't flush $100 billion down the toilet. The idea that they've gotten away with it for this long is not a bull pitch; it means there are a set of entrenched managers there who think it's OK to run their business this way.I'll be interested when the stock price hits $10-12 and I start hearing that people want to work there, because I think that's about where you'd start seeing a chance for meaningful upside from a turnaround. At $23 all the good things you're hoping for are priced in.",2,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve.

From everything I've read/ heard, starting in the early 2000s they changed to being a company of more marginal engineering talent led by beancounters.Same thing is now playing out with Boeing. All the old long-time time Boeing employees who retired 10+ years ago are dismayed at how the company culture today is nothing like it was years ago. It was a company that took pride in its culture of engineering, safety, etc. Now it's top focus is earnings.Until Intel addresses this issue, nothing else they do will really move the needle (stock price) positively.",0,nan,nan,nan

So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",Seriously you guys need to stop looking at turnarounds and look at stocks that are skyrocketing.

We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight.

,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now.

But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",,0,nan,nan,nan
,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years.

They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight.

,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now.
