,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/tsmc-q3-earnings-profit-beats-expectations-as-ai-boom-drives-54percent-hike-.html,Depends. More then likely if Taiwan looks like they are going to lose. Those fabs are going to be destroyed. Either by Taiwan themselves or by US making sure China doesn't benefit from them. The problem China has is that they can't replicate the equipment needed. There is a difference between having the knowledge. and having working hardware. They can steal blueprints all the want. But they don't have the underlying tech to make the equipment. Anyways Taiwan would probably move operations to the US the company and tech would still exist. But I doubt China would succeed in an invasion. Too many issues with logistics and being able to supply troops with any type of hypothetical invasion anyways.,1,nan,nan,nan
