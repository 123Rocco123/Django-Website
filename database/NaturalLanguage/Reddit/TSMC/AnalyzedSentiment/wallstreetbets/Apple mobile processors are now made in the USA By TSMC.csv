,nan,"There are a lot of other applications that 4nm is ample for, so no this isn’t a waste",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yeah 4nm is still more than efficient enough for mobile processors and especially for Apple Silicon.This is kind of huge for TSMC, Apple and the US government.Apple can flaunt homegrown chips, the government can flaunt rising microprocessor industries and TSMC retains it’s position as the only reason China isn’t balls deep in Taiwan yet.It’s honestly kind of genius when you think about it.",4,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"Look at TSMC earnings and customers. They do don’t need the money, their top priority is keeping TSMC / Taiwan safe. What do you think will happen to Taiwan once the US fabs gets the latest nodes? The geopolitical risks far outweighs a few billion dollars of gov money.",3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,I mean that’s fine. If ww3 happens we can deal with some slightly worse chips if world trade falls apart.That’s a fair deal depending on how much the US spent,3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"4nm chips are pretty closing to bleeding edge. China’s native manufacturing is at 8nm? Or maybe 16nm.There are lots of applications for these chips, even if it’s not the absolute best possible.Also chip design > fab size.A well designed 4nm chip could perform just as well as a smaller fab chip.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yeah, people acting like the US got ripped off because it doesn’t quite have the absolute best fabs is crazy.These 4nm fabs might be way more reliable and higher yields anyway.",4,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"My mistake, 2028 is correct.However, I assume you have an engineering degree, which is why you made the bold claim Alibaba is going to be $800 lmao. Go get a finance degree.Nobody in their right minds wants anything to do with Chinese tech giants, they kidnapped their CEO, forced him to step down, and now the company has to divest and split into 6 entities. China has hindered their economy by not allowing the free market to dictate, and the CCP will never allow any of their tech giants to be more powerful than them. Nobody in finance trusts Chinese financial accounting, not even Chinese citizens. It’s why they invest overseas mainly in the US.Alibaba is never going to go back to being a trillion dollar company let alone 2 trillion+ like you claim. If sentiment flips in China, maybe it can go back to 300 billion and trade around its fair value of $120 but it’s not going anywhere near where it was when people thought China had changed.",5,nan,nan,nan

,nan,At that level process nodes don’t matter anymore it’s all about chip design,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Depends on cost sensitivity and hard requirements for performance per watt.There will always be some application willing to pay 2x as much for 5% more performance.,2,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"As you said, not everything needs to be 2nm leading edge process.",3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,The latest iPhones are using n3e chips,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I see the us government heavily invested and focused on intel. They funded intel with billions recently to manufacture chips for US military. Why everyone is bearish on the company?,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Intel doesn’t even have a node as good as TSMC’s 5n and 5n isn’t even the most advanced node that TSMC has. Intel is 5 years behind at least. They can’t be competitive in bleeding edge chips as a result,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Fair enough but the market still has heavy demand for dumb chips,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"The problem for dumb chips is that Intel is expensive. TSMC has a similar dynamic for US produced chips, charging something like 30% more for US production lines.",3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,So short Texas Instruments?,5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"FAA makes getting approval for new designs extremely expensive and difficult, and nobody ever changes the designs for legacy contracts because it's inconvenient and often a financial drain.For those reasons alone, TI will be producing dumb super obsolete chips for old airplanes and FAA related craft for decades to come. They've got permanent business with a government that has ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" basically baked into its defense policy.",6,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"There is no path to return to dominance.The market is highly sentimental, with Nvidia's stocks reflecting that their AI-centric sales pipeline will be sold out for the next three years.Meanwhile, intel is like, give us 5 years to release the chip…..You decide why Nana would be disappointed.",3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,Intel can keep that business and TSMC dgaf. USG buys a lot of shit from companies that aren't competitive enough to sell in the commercial market.,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"US gov dumping money into something rarely actually works, broadband and high speed internet were paid for to telcoms many times over with meager results.Even if you're overall long-term bullish on intel and think they can turn it around, part of that turnaround process is deprioritizing shareholders and prioritizing the company, ie. deprioritizing you. Might as well put your money elsewhere in the meantime.",1,nan,nan,nan

,nan,do the processors then get shipped to china for literal slaves to assemble into the rest of the device in some foxcon factory?,0,nan,nan,nan

,nan,Is that true?Edit: I see what you mean. The phone itself. Not components of the chip,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yes? TSMC is heavily subsidized by the Taiwanese government and a crucial component of their economy and national security. They’re not just a luxury for the west, we can’t just replace them or boycott them if they don’t do what we say.",1,nan,nan,nan
