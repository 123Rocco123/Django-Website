AI growth will have an impact, but not that much in the short term and they will also run into difficulties with capacity to satisfy demand on advanced products. The last caller gave them silver platter of an assist to finish with a bang, asking why TSMC sells advanced chips for a few hundred that their customers can resell for tens of thousands or more, and if they had any thoughts about capturing more value from their customers. They could've said they will constantly monitor their pricing to ensure they capture maximum value, but instead said they are happy their customers make shit tons of profit. They might as well have said they are balls deep in NVDA calls and will be posting gain porn soon.
