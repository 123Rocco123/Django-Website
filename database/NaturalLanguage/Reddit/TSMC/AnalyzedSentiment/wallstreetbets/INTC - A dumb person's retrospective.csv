,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock. You WSBers nowadays don't even know how ridiculed you were for even considering AMD. 2015 to 2017 were peak AMD years on this sub when regards jumped the gun, bought calls because MUH mindfactory data and muh 1% min benchmarks losing them everything over and over again. You kids don't even know struggle. Struggle is putting your 1k paycheck on AMD calls every week thinking this week you will hit. Just to watch Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs dropping a $12 PT downgrade on you when the stock turns even a little bullish. The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock. I bought and sold Intel throughout the year. 8000 shares from 35 to 50, sold at 43, bought at 35, sold at 30 before earnings. I was up 130k, lost 100k of it. Bought 2500 shares at 21.30. I think it can go lower in the short term, wouldn't be surprised for it to momentarily touch below 20.",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan

What if they want Intel to become a TSMC like company and ditch the CPU business? We are talking about politics here and politics is the antonym of logicTrueOr TSMC knows something that Intel doesn’t. If you’re so vested in the underlying technology just buy ASMLPeople are bearish because the way to recovery for Intel is long and hard. They already wasted 6 years.The last line is always $0, bigger companies have reached it before. Telling yourself otherwise is lying to yourself.Yes and AMD completely reinvented themselves with Lisa Su at the helm. Sure they are far away from AI but maybe that’s a better strategy. AMD today dominates the x86 market and everything they do from consumer relations to media coverage is in their favour. Objectively speaking AMD is a great long position.What history? AMD fought hard to reestablish themselves on the market. Intel is just beginning that journey and they should have started it in 2019 not now. Go see the consumer subs here like r/pcmasterrace - people love AMD and hate Intel.It’s your money, and you can win if Intel actually realises that they are in big trouble.

I remember it as not much more than a penny stock. But it was a penny stock because it was a shit company back then.I invested in them long ago and to me all they ever were was the chip version of a utility stock. Yeah, you had your yearly upgrades in chips, but all they ever really did was embed them into Windows machines so with semi-annual upgrades, you get steady business. Nothing they were doing was ever innovative, which is why they have been completely and utterly dominated by everyone over the last decade. Basically IBM for chip manufacturers.That was reason enough for me to sell and not regret thinking twice about it and they clearly were never worth any premium being paid for the stock.But after a near 30% haircut, INTC at least warrants another look. I doubt I’ll end up there without some clear leadership guidance that isn’t more of the same, but Grandma’s inheritance gots to go somewhere.",0,nan,nan,nan

I first got interested in INTC as a stock in 2011. I looked at its roadmap. There were ticks and tocks. They were to have 16-core, 2nm processors by 2021, running on the power-saving, RISC architecture that was the successor to x86. Following Moore's Law, they expected their chips to power applications such as natural language processing and autonomous humanoid robot operations. I remember laughing as the furthest-future announced process node was named Coffee Lake. ""A lake of coffee,"" I thought. ""Just what I need!""Meanwhile they were going to expand into mobile (phone and laptop), GPU, server, memory (optane), optical couplings, and SoC applications. They were going to build world-class, cutting edge fabs for all these applications. The capital expenditure roadmap was all laid out.In 2013 I bought a 22nm Ivy Bridge CPU, the 3770K. 4 cores, 8 with hyperthreading. It was ""overclockable"" and based on the predecessor, the 28nm Sandy Bridge, I had high hopes. These weren't dashed; the thing ran 3.6 GHz out of the box but people had theirs running up to 5.0 GHz. I got mine stable at 4.5, but it was generating enough heat that I feared premature degradation of the signal paths so I ran it on 4.4 daily for the next 5 years. Hyperthreading never was very much of a thing; benchmarks that used it upped the heat output substantially.A couple years ago, I bought its replacement, a 9700K.By then, mobile, phone, memory and SoC were flashes in the pan that had passed their expiration date; Intel achieved their capital expenditure goals (exceeding them substantially in most cases) but no other part of the programs were successful, and were discarded. Jury's still out on optical, though the abundance of startups (POET, LITE) suggest they failed to write enough patents; with regard to GPU, Arc lol. Meanwhile they built the fabs, spending billions, but the fabs didn't reward them with chips; most Intel products for which there is actual demand are now fabbed by TSMC. Tick-tock had given way to process-architecture-optimization (I think someone might have been banging Ellen PAO;) which quickly gave way to ""I'm not sure what the fuck we're doing,"" although I think they picked a different name for that one. x86 successor? Vaporware anyone?That 9700K? 8 physical x86 cores, running at 4.9 out of the box. I went to overclock them and noticed that the chip, supposedly a 14nm node, ran hotter at stock than my 3770K ever did under any stable overclock. The 9700K would not OC stable at 5.0, meaning that it was out of headroom right out of the box. I examined the chip closely and learned that it had the ability to vary voltages on the fly, something overclockers of yore hadn't been able to leverage; but that that was necessary for it to be stable even at its rated 4.9; it really seemed to offer very little benefit in real world use (heat, power consumption, benchmark, real world) over that old 3770K. Nothing used the 8 virtual cores, I couldn't even find a benchmark let alone a real world application. Sure, it was 10% quicker. 5 years and $100B of capex later? For a 10% bump? The excess energy must have been transferred to Gordon Moore's angular momentum because bro is surely spinning in his grave.""Oh well,"" I thought. ""They'll have to innovate now, because they've overclocked their legacy architecture as much as they can; next step is molecular breakdown of the signal paths due to excess heat and amperage, shortening chip life. No one would sell a chip that did that!""Hmm. About that: Raptor Lake chips show unusual number of crashes/BSODs resulting in a need for warranty extension. INTC just announced they'd replace their overamperaged chips yesterday; previously they'd issued a few statements that boiled down to ""If you're going to overclock one of our chips, which in this case means you ran it at the suggested voltage printed on the box, you're SOL,"" but I guess that got thrown out in yesterday's wash. Note that in the intervening 5 years since 14nm - when we were supposed to be on 'optimization' of a 2nm node - we are still on 10nm.So yeah. Rancid donkey nuts. If I needed a lesson on how to piss away $100B, I'd ask Jacob Zuma, not these fuckos.",0,nan,nan,nan

As part of this restructuring, AMD announced that 7% of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014.""In 2012 AMD lay off 12%. They then laid off 7%. This is all just noise.
