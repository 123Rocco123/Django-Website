,"AI has a place in the future economy no doubt. Regulated it will help some sectors unregulated it will create mass unemployment. Even down to the programmers who built it and web designers and all kinds of modern jobs that are fanboys of the tech industry not realizing you’re cheering your own future unemployment. Doesn’t matter if we all adapt to new tech, it is too fast for any previous models of adaptation. Nvidia is currently standing at 2.22T at yesterdays close. Yes idiot market cap is the same as price! Roughly 2.26T right now while writing this in premarket. If you think wow and that the market ever values correctly stop reading. You’re just an idiot. But if you want some facts. The amazing revenue and earnings growth of nvidia lately correlates to the equal drop in intel revenue and earnings. Go figure huh since intel used to be the dragon of datacenters and a lot of datacenters has now switched to GPU structures. It also correlates with AMD killing Intel on the CPU front bu AMD is still not growing revenue nor is it barely profitable right now. The meteoric rise also correlates with all of SOX/PHLX going straight up (because idiot speak always thinks one company good means all sector good). Meteoric rises in every other semiconductor stock. TSMC produces roughly 80% of the chips in the world and supply most of these companies. TSMC has shrunk their revenue and earnings since 2022. Funny when unless you have mega inventories suppliers always sell to the producer before the producer to other businesses or consumers. Weird huh? But back to the bubble and I won’t bore you with key data because you can look that up yourselves and investopedia / google normal ranges for metrics but I’ll give you another fun fact instead. Some think nvidia can just repeat the stock price increase the next 5 year that it has had the past 5 years. That would only take nvidia above 45T of market value, the current TOTAL market value of only listed US stocks as of Jan 2024 is a little over 50T. “It can totally happen dude”. If you want one company to exist and kill the value of the rest of the market sure or if you want one company creating inflation in the whole world when you want to liquidate / sell sure. Why have the fed when you have nvidia. LOL. Oh maybe to print the liquidity for said liquidation. NO IT FUCKIN CAN’T. Stock market is also inflation. In stock price, in product price to try to keep said stock price. In monopoly when competition can’t stop the company product price increase, one man’s cost is just another man’s price duh. Stocks usually rise before consumer price inflation which CPI very pooorly measures and the hidden inflation of printing presses / money creation (now digital) destroys value of everything. No you can’t hedge against inflation, in fact most of gdp growth is inflation next to global population growth and more consumers being born and said newborns become the global growing middle class. But wait AI solves everything. No it doesn’t because nothing isn’t worth anything. Money is just a credit and contract for future consumption so until you buy something like say 1 kebab your money has no value in between you earning it spending it and in this example eat it and shit it out. It’s a credit instead of being paid in said kebab or barter tangible produce. You work for free and your money is worth shit both literally and figuratively. 1 quadrillion x 0 is still zero so print however much you want all money still lose “all value” because of what it is anyway. Lest we print unlimited for everyone and be done. Internet was a bubble, but it was useful after the bubble. Electric vehicles was/is a bubble, but it is useful after the recent bubble. Green energy was a bubble but is useful after the bubble. AI is a bubble and is useful after the bubble, if regulated. “but it’s different this time” Yeah, it was different since tulips. Good luck with that, good luck when too many is trying to sell liquidate at the same time. What is most impressive?

Best of luck regards","The ""internet"" bubble was just a part of ""computing""....something that started somewhere in the 1960's to finally 1980's when mini computers (DEC) got smaller and ""micro"" computers found their way to the desktop. (IBM, Apple and with Microsoft)The internet was essentially not the internet as much as it was TCP/IP networking and it's rapid adoption which enabled computers to communicate fast and over long distances.The internet bubble popped because it was mostly frothy non-tech people not understanding ""computing"".AI is almost universally mis-understood. It is not ""AI"" it is just a moniker for a change in computing.What is happening is the world is being overrun with data at an ever increasing rate. Regarded programmers long cast aside efficient slow coding and simply gave up and used whatever was the easiest and quickest to code. CPU and memory was getting more powerful and cheaper. So they just dump everything into some sort of database sitting in storage in the on prem datacenter. When storage got full they bought another, and another, moved some to clunky tapes but that was too expensive so they just kept all the data spinning on disk.What use to to be paper and film everywhere is now binary data. Most of it is kept forever because no one knows what to do with it and are afraid to trash it.Our current computing systems and technology is incapable of managing and or processing all that data. Humans cannot even gather it discrete piles fast enough to get any modicum of value from it.Having worked in technology since the 80's for a number of large corps across many sectors I can say it is a lost battle. We are just getting by and being piled under petabytes of data every second.I agree that many aspects of this ""change in computing"" as realized by the public is AI and as such has morphed into a specific bubble.But what is under the skin of this bubble is the meat of wholesale change in computing. Like monolithic server computing gave way to client server which gave way to N-Tier, computing is now giving way to distributed network data processing via high speed cloud computing with the network itself becoming the computer. (some call it edge computing)AI (more accurately neural network computing) is going to be at the core of how we interface with data. AI bot agents, acting autonomously to manage systems to enable humans to be more efficient and useful with the enormous glut of garbage data we have made.Right now we have ""big dumb data"" soon we will have ""smarter big dumb data"" and beyond we won't ever care about data because it will be taken care of autonomously by ""AI"" robotic agents on the network.AI will never be truly intelligent in our lifetime. It is still a neural network trained to mimic a response of a simple very tiny brain for a specific task. If anyone says anything different about what AI is they are blowing smoke up your ass.But one fact remains, our datacenters will be gloriously fast in a few years.Everyone has to upgrade their corporate datacenters to a hybrid on-prem, cloud solution and implement some aspect of autonomous system management.That is where my 3-5 year investments are going. I wish I was younger...to live long enough to see quantum computing which is where all this is heading.sorry for being old, risk averse...a retired, late nerdy boomer freak, tech worker and talking.I am only here to score a few more wins before I die for my daughter.back to lurking...",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

I set aside a small amount for investing in a 3-5 year hit.I have a few small speculative bets on some AI - security small caps and streaming entertainment.But at the core, ARM (got in early Dec.) and ANET have advanced tech that has legs. Both pretty safe longs in my book. Though ARM has the risk of sell off through march into july. But like I said I got in early. I will likely get back into SMCI soon. Took profit last week. Looking for re-entry next week or so around 905. (shorting SMCI would be very risky)My strategy is to cover the new emerging computing stack, processing unit and chips, datacenter hardware, and finally software. (right now I like CDNS as ""software"" is really going to be more custom chip based rather than compiled executables)THink network based data processing, chip based agent technology responding to user requests and alerts to perform tasks. The ""PC"" will slither away. We went from shared desktops (1980s), to individual desktops 90,s) to laptops (10s), to tablets. (20s many people just get tablets now) but eventually that personal screen will go away and interfaces will be built into things that respond to us when we are near or ask. We will likely just have a personal agent device, a screen less smart ""phone"".NVDA I took profit already. But might re-enter.More into smallish and mid caps that have room to expand. But...as in all things nothing is safe in stocks. Not advice, just find what works for you and be patient and watch upcoming tech IPOs and emerging tech start ups...jumping on some tech IPOs could becoming a thing again after ARMs IPO success...make sure the tech is mature though...ARM was known to me for a long time.Good luck...",2,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.998

They highlight the correlation between Nvidia's success, Intel's decline, and shifts in semiconductor stocks. The author questions the sustainability of Nvidia's stock price growth and warns against the idea that one company could dominate the market. They argue that the stock market is a form of inflation and discuss the role of AI in addressing economic challenges, emphasizing the importance of regulation. The author concludes by noting the regular creation and bursting of bubbles in various sectors in today's market.",0,0.565,NEGATIVE,0.771

Even down to the programmers who built it and web designers and all kinds of modern jobs that are fanboys of the tech industry not realizing you’re cheering your own future unemployment. Doesn’t matter if we all adapt to new tech, it is too fast for any previous models of adaptation. Nvidia is currently standing at 2.22T at yesterdays close. Yes idiot market cap is the same as price! Roughly 2.26T right now while writing this in premarket. If you think wow and that the market ever values correctly stop reading. You’re just an idiot. But if you want some facts. The amazing revenue and earnings growth of nvidia lately correlates to the equal drop in intel revenue and earnings. Go figure huh since intel used to be the dragon of datacenters and a lot of datacenters has now switched to GPU structures. It also correlates with AMD killing Intel on the CPU front bu AMD is still not growing revenue nor is it barely profitable right now. The meteoric rise also correlates with all of SOX/PHLX going straight up (because idiot speak always thinks one company good means all sector good). Meteoric rises in every other semiconductor stock. TSMC produces roughly 80% of the chips in the world and supply most of these companies. TSMC has shrunk their revenue and earnings since 2022. Funny when unless you have mega inventories suppliers always sell to the producer before the producer to other businesses or consumers. Weird huh? But back to the bubble and I won’t bore you with key data because you can look that up yourselves and investopedia / google normal ranges for metrics but I’ll give you another fun fact instead. Some think nvidia can just repeat the stock price increase the next 5 year that it has had the past 5 years. That would only take nvidia above 45T of market value, the current TOTAL market value of only listed US stocks as of Jan 2024 is a little over 50T. “It can totally happen dude”. If you want one company to exist and kill the value of the rest of the market sure or if you want one company creating inflation in the whole world when you want to liquidate / sell sure. Why have the fed when you have nvidia. LOL. Oh maybe to print the liquidity for said liquidation. NO IT FUCKIN CAN’T. Stock market is also inflation. In stock price, in product price to try to keep said stock price. In monopoly when competition can’t stop the company product price increase, one man’s cost is just another man’s price duh. Stocks usually rise before consumer price inflation which CPI very pooorly measures and the hidden inflation of printing presses / money creation (now digital) destroys value of everything. No you can’t hedge against inflation, in fact most of gdp growth is inflation next to global population growth and more consumers being born and said newborns become the global growing middle class. But wait AI solves everything. No it doesn’t because nothing isn’t worth anything. Money is just a credit and contract for future consumption so until you buy something like say 1 kebab your money has no value in between you earning it spending it and in this example eat it and shit it out. It’s a credit instead of being paid in said kebab or barter tangible produce. You work for free and your money is worth shit both literally and figuratively. 1 quadrillion x 0 is still zero so print however much you want all money still lose “all value” because of what it is anyway. Lest we print unlimited for everyone and be done. Internet was a bubble, but it was useful after the bubble. Electric vehicles was/is a bubble, but it is useful after the recent bubble. Green energy was a bubble but is useful after the bubble. AI is a bubble and is useful after the bubble, if regulated. “but it’s different this time” Yeah, it was different since tulips. Good luck with that, good luck when too many is trying to sell liquidate at the same time. What is most impressive? Is the current market state where we create and pop bubbles in different sectors more regularly than ever before! I hope you’re not the same person/bot behind every single one.
