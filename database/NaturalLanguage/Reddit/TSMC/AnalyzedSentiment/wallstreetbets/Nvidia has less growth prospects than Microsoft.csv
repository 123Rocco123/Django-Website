,"Assuming Nvidia meets revenue and margin guidance next quarter, their Q1 EPS will grow to $5.62. Even if this number was flat for each quarter of the coming year (and it will obviously grow, since their demand > supply), they are currently trading at, based on a current share price of $729, a forward PE ratio of 32.4. Their revenue for the calendar year was up 126%, while their net income was up 286%. Microsoft is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 34.72. Their revenue for the fiscal year was up 7% YoY, while net income was up 6% YoY. Tesla's forward PE ratio is 62.13; do they have anything similar when it comes to growth prospects? No. In the prior quarter, their revenue was up 8% YoY and their net income was down 44%. I know Nvidia's share price growth over the last year seems insane. I know it looks like a meme stock, about to crater. But it is not. It is still tremendously undervalued. The post title is a bit of clickbait, because I don't believe it, and obviously no one else does either, but yet it is literally the current valuation of the stocks market. Either Microsoft and Tesla are both about to utterly implode, or Nvidia still has another 30-50% of gains left in the tank. Maybe even more. To clarify, I have no shares or options on Nvidia. My only significant holding is in TSMC.

Either Microsoft and Tesla are both about to utterly implode, or Nvidia still has another 30-50% of gains left in the tank. Maybe even more. To clarify, I have no shares or options on Nvidia. My only significant holding is in TSMC. I just did the research and couldn't believe the numbers. edit: double clarification for the super regards: I have no puts or short positions on Microsoft or Tesla either. Christ almighty, I’m just tryna help some regards see the light and get their tendies smh","Microsoft would be one of the biggest money makers thanks to AI products and yet I don't see them chanting about how much money they're earning. a lot of companies are buying from nvidia to join the bandwagon, and hopefully they can make some money because if they fail to pay the loans, it won't be good for anyone.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Assuming Nvidia meets revenue and margin guidance next quarter, their Q1 EPS will grow to $5.62. Even if this number was flat for each quarter of the coming year (and it will obviously grow, since their demand > supply), they are currently trading at, based on a current share price of $729, a forward PE ratio of 32.4. Their revenue for the calendar year was up 126%, while their net income was up 286%. Microsoft is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 34.72. Their revenue for the fiscal year was up 7% YoY, while net income was up 6% YoY. Tesla's forward PE ratio is 62.13; do they have anything similar when it comes to growth prospects? No. In the prior quarter, their revenue was up 8% YoY and their net income was down 44%. I know Nvidia's share price growth over the last year seems insane. I know it looks like a meme stock, about to crater. But it is not. It is still tremendously undervalued. The post title is a bit of clickbait, because I don't believe it, and obviously no one else does either, but yet it is literally the current valuation of the stocks market.

Bezos once said ""your margins are my opportunity"". i'm sure there are a million degens sitting in Bezos 1990's used-desk shitty offices trying to out-do NVDA. one guy, Jonathan has been trying this for 8 years. He has something called Groq (not to be mistaken with Grok) that very well may be the nvidia killer. try it here https://groq.com/ (i own no interest in groq)",0,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.884
