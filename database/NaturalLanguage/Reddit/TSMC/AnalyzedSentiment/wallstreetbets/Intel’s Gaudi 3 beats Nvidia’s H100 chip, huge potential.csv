NVDA, GOOG, INTC among others participate by publishing results.It may not translate to stock price because NVDA has the CUDA moat. Most ML/AI libraries and software vendors are locked in to it. But itâ€™s not as big a moat as some claim. Because itâ€™s Software after all.

Intel will need to juice this with donations to universities to encourage use of software that runs on Gaudi chips and provide subsidies to companies that hire these students as interns. As they say in high tech, the world changes in 18 months, so this is all possible if Intel is focused on it. My question for Intel is ""are you?""Note: Intel has this to say about PyTorch, which indicates that they are aware of the importance of these ML engineers: "" Intel also works closely with the open source PyTorch project to optimize the PyTorch framework for Intel hardware.

If Taiwan's manufacturing becomes problematic due to a March amphibious assault financials of these companies will suffer. Out-scoring each other on benchmarks won't matter if there are supply chain disruptions. (recall the recent pandemic chaos) TSMC is building new fabs globally, so the question will be which one of these players can lock up the scarce supply. Intel is probably the worst positioned here because they have fabs that compete with TSMC.

NVIDIA is trying to deal with that by making custom chips for individual customers, but for customers who are deciding between an H100 or other chip, they may look at which chip is optimized for their workload while factoring in the price.

,"Sold Nvidia at $200 because ethereum went proof of stake and i saw that 30% of nvidiaâ€™s revenue was from GPU miningâ€¦. Now i bought back into auxillary semiconductor corpos like intel, broadcomm, TSMC","TLDR: For now Nvidia is ahead. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and their optimized libraries like CUBlas (cuda basic linear algebra subroutines), and CUDNN(cuda deep neural network) are ahead.Details:CUDA is lower lower-level implementation that allows you to program the GPU directly, but you don't need to work directly with it as NVIDIA has optimized libraries such as CUBlas, CUDnn.Brief Comparison:Intel v/s CUDA API: Intel has a lower level API, OneAPI which is lower level like CUDA. CUDA is more mature.Hardware: Intel uses XMX cores akin to Tensor Cores, they are primary operations in an AI workload, i.e. matrix multiplication. For example, a 4*4 matrix multiplication can be performed in a single clock cycle with a tensor core.Pytorch Support: Most people don't have to use the Intel or CUDA API, they can use higher level API like pytorch and both of them support it.So it's to be seen if and when intel can release hardware and software for that hardware that is as optimized or better than Nvidia.",0,0.52,POSITIVE,0.894
