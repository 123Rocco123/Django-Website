,"Assuming Nvidia meets revenue and margin guidance next quarter, their Q1 EPS will grow to $5.62. Even if this number was flat for each quarter of the coming year (and it will obviously grow, since their demand > supply), they are currently trading at, based on a current share price of $729, a forward PE ratio of 32.4. Their revenue for the calendar year was up 126%, while their net income was up 286%. Microsoft is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 34.72. Their revenue for the fiscal year was up 7% YoY, while net income was up 6% YoY. Tesla's forward PE ratio is 62.13; do they have anything similar when it comes to growth prospects? No. In the prior quarter, their revenue was up 8% YoY and their net income was down 44%. I know Nvidia's share price growth over the last year seems insane. I know it looks like a meme stock, about to crater. But it is not. It is still tremendously undervalued. Either Microsoft and Tesla are both about to utterly implode, or Nvidia still has another 30-50% of gains left in the tank. Maybe even more.

They were able to achieve this tremendous growth not because they were scaling up but because they were the first mover and were able to jack up prices of their cards 500% in very short-term time frame.Their ability to scale up production wise is heavily constrained by TSM ability to produce their product.Microsoft is a software company. Their ability to scale is on another level compared to NVDA. They do not rely on some Taiwanese chip makers for their business growth. They can copy and paste their software endlessly and sell the subscriptions anywhere on this world. Every fool can afford their services. 5 billion potential customers. How many customers is NVDA potential reach? The main NVDA customers that make them 90% of their profits are those same mega corps that are working now relentlessly to design their own chip and say goodbye to NVDAs price gouging tactics.I think we are very close to the point where NVDA will get some serious competition.That's why I believe MSFT is way better investment right now.,2,0.553,POSITIVE,0.993
