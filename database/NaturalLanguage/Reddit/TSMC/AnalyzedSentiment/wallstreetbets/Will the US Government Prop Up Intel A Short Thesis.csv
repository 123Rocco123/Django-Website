,"Recently I have seen speculation on the subreddit that Intel may receive support from the US government so the US can cease reliance on TSMC, and can cease risking war with China over the island. This proposition has been used to justify bullishness in regard to Intel's recovery from it's recent crash. However, with respect to the proponents of this idea, I find such a proposition to be in error, as I would argue the US has more interest in Taiwan than merely semiconductor production. In addition to being a bastion of Asian democracy, Taiwan is of critical strategic naval value, as it is a linchpin in controlling travel between the East and South China seas and the wider Pacific ocean, along with South Korea, Vietnam (who despite also being nominally Communist has it's own axe to grind with China), and Japan. As long as this access to the Pacific Ocean is controlled by US allies (or in Vietnam's case, a country that is just as pissed off with China), China is far less able to project military power internationally. In other words, the US has a vested geopolitical interest in defending Taiwan, even if we ignore semiconductor chips. Thus, I argue it makes no sense for the US to prioritise removing its dependence on TSMC in favour of Intel, and I suggest that the belief that Intel will receive propping up by the US is wishful thinking at best. I also want to say that I am not trying to make the case for a bearish future for Intel or any other company, but I would caution against excessive optimism that the US will prop up the struggling company. It may for other reasons, but from the perspective of an International Relations student, I would caution against this logic.",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan

,"Recently I have seen speculation on the subreddit that Intel may receive support from the US government so the US can cease reliance on TSMC, and can cease risking war with China over the island. This proposition has been used to justify bullishness in regard to Intel's recovery from it's recent crash. However, with respect to the proponents of this idea, I find such a proposition to be in error, as I would argue the US has more interest in Taiwan than merely semiconductor production. In addition to being a bastion of Asian democracy, Taiwan is of critical strategic naval value, as it is a linchpin in controlling travel between the East and South China seas and the wider Pacific ocean, along with South Korea, Vietnam (who despite also being nominally Communist has it's own axe to grind with China), and Japan. As long as this access to the Pacific Ocean is controlled by US allies (or in Vietnam's case, a country that is just as pissed off with China), China is far less able to project military power internationally. In other words, the US has a vested geopolitical interest in defending Taiwan, even if we ignore semiconductor chips. Thus, I argue it makes no sense for the US to prioritise removing its dependence on TSMC in favour of Intel, and I suggest that the belief that Intel will receive propping up by the US is wishful thinking at best.

You think the US cares enough if china has a faster chip for a smartphone to defend a whole island somewhere far away for it? absolutely not. But they care that china doesnt have the top level know-how for chip making under their control because that would mean china could potentially build better weapon systems than the US.the entire US world image and economy is reliant on being number one. You cannot force trade agreements down peoples throat, like telling ASML not to deliver to china, when you cannot back it up with the unquestionably biggest firepower.bottom line is, yes the US wont like it but will let it happen if china takes taiwan once TSMC isnt the world leader anymore. you dont believe it? look at what happened in ukraine. Of course the US doesnt like that. but it aint sending troops. If ASML was located there instead of the netherlands it would already be over. and guess what. ukraine is a democracy.does that mean they will prop up Intel? you cant just prop up top line chip building. its a gamble on technology and a steep learning curve. but they will for sure help as much as they can. its in the US best interest to have that know-how back in US-owned business. but its not a sure shot. thats why TSMC is building fabs all over the world as a second possibility.

,"Recently I have seen speculation on the subreddit that Intel may receive support from the US government so the US can cease reliance on TSMC, and can cease risking war with China over the island.

Not only is China's economy heavily dependent of Western countries buying their goods, the trade of which sanctions would wreck, but Taiwan is a geographic fortress, and the US army and Japanese Self-Defence Forces have bases nearby that could counter attack pretty rapidly. I honestly think Taiwan may well be able to hold it's defence- even if their odds aren't great, they're better than Ukraine's odds at the beginning of the war with Russia. And they've had over half a century to prepare, while Ukraine had a matter of years. I think the only case where China would attack Taiwan would be if Xi Jinping was in a Leopoldo Galtieri situation where the only way to save his regime from internal dissent and rebellion would be to gamble on attacking Taiwan (as Galtieri did with the Falklands) to stir up patriotism at home.Disclaimer: I touched wood.",3,nan,nan,nan

If we reduce our dependence on Taiwan/TSMC, then it removes a bargaining chip from China's arsenal. This is geopolitics 101: If you want to play hardball, you have to be able to squeeze. Every day that goes by, as we move supply chains and other effect other ways to reduce our reliance on China, their ability to coerce us or anyone else to their side is diminished.Meanwhile, we still have SWYFT, international consensus, the rest of the ASEAN nations, etc.This is very similar to what we did after the Oil Embargo of 1973 - the US realized we can never again be in such a position and thus the Houston oil boom was begun. It went sideways for a while due to overproduction/speculation. But then the 1st Gulf war really upended shit and displayed to even the pacificist beta-cucks in government that we were still vulnerable to oil producers. Fast forward 20 or so years - we are now the world's #1 producer of oil/nat gas - If the Arab/OPEC nations were to try to embargo us, it would certainly hurt, but the damage to their economies would be far more catastrophic since it is essentially, the only way they fund their governments. So, in effect, we have taken away their one huge bargaining chip. That's why they do what we tell them to and Israel can play Nintendo wars with anyone they like. Unlike the middle east oil producing countries, out entire economy does not really on one single product.Sidenote: They truly are a stupid, short-sighted group of nations. Instead of using their trillions of revenues from oil to develop their economies and reduce their reliance on the United States, they instead buy Bentley's to race around the desert, golden toilets to shit on, and charter planes to fly their falcons around.A Saudi prince bought airplane seats for all 80 of his falcons :tl;dr - Murica",0,nan,nan,nan
