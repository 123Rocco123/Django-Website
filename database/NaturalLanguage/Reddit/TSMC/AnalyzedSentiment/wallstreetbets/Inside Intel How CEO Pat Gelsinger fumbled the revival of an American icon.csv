,"Reuter‚Äôs Summary: ‚Ä¢ Gelsinger's comments offended TSMC, which did not honor discount. ‚Ä¢ Revenue and stock price have declined sharply under Gelsinger. ‚Ä¢ Intel's 18A chip process faces delays and technical Issues.","Reuters sources are 100% regarded if they think INTC had some special 40% discount on 3nm out of the kindness of TSMC‚Äôs heart. They wanted them hooked on that sweet product so that Intel would cancel their fab plans. At that point, once fully dependent on TSMC, the discount would have been revoked and prices actually raised 40%.",0,nan,nan,nan
