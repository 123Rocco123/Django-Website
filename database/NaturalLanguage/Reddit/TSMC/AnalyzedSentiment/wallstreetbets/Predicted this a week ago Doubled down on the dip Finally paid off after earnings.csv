,Made a few bucks on the TSM & SPY Call options.,"With how much in taxpayer handouts Intel is getting, their long term prospects are really good. Many western countries, especially the US, are basically paying for a huge chunk of their capex.Considering they cut their dividend and stopped buybacks, laid off a ton of employees, and are receiving a ton of government money, I'd be very shocked if Intel goes bankrupt.With that said, calls are a moronic way to capitalize on this. The ROI on these new fabs will take several years.Pretty much the only reason to buy calls is to speculate on Intel being acquired. Intel could pop after the election if a certain party(that is more lenient on anti trust) wins.",1,nan,nan,nan
,Made a few bucks on the TSM & SPY Call options.,I agree. I believe intel is currently undervalued. I might buy a long-term call option as it has so much potential. Especially with the new AI tech hype. They are a great company and it’s a matter of time when they surprise the public with some bullish news.,2,nan,nan,nan
