,nan,Look for tonight's TSMC Call to explain Nvidia Tensions and how ASML will gain more AI gains from Blackwells insatiable need and then Rubin and then the Next chips all coming in a 1 year cadence.ASML was blindsided by China restrictions and a still out of favor PC upgrade cycle.Ignore all that. The 25% thrashing ASML took is way over done. They have been hinting quarter after quarter of weakness and finally just laid out the year low guidance.AI is ramping up and the RTX 50** series along with AMD updates to their GPUs' are coming soon Q1 2025.Buy RED Sell GREEN,0,nan,nan,nan
