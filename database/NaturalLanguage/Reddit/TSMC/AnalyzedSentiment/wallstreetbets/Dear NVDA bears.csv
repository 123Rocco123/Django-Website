,"You guys are trippin when you use steady-growth valuation techniques for companies of huge-growth like NVDA. Itâ€™s like trying to fit Shaqâ€™s foot into Cinderellaâ€™s slipper! Their revenues doubled over a quarter, faster than rabbits on Viagra, with projections of further growth in the future. OpenAI and Google's recent advancements in AI are compelling (Sora and gemini 1.5). And for the foreseeable future they will have to pay NVDA to keep the AI revved up and not just for development but for usage (60% 40% of their revenue is inference), which they will have no problem doing considering how much profit they expect to gain from AI services. Google invested billions in their TPU, billions into DeepMind and google Brain, billions into Waymo, Bard and Gemini and they are still heavily truck-loading NVDA GPUs! Why? Because NVDA platform is a better solution. This industry is not about hardware only, software is a huge component. NVDA has a reputation of proven solutions and such status commands a premium in the enterprise market. Also NVDA secured priority access to TSMCâ€™s manufacturing resources due to TSMC flow of production capacity. So until TSMC expands its supply to exceed NVDA demand, you have nothing to worry about. And one more thing. If we truly achieve AGI then there's no limit for NVDA. They have always kept up on R&D to protect thier moat and they deal in much more than just hardware. If you believe what you are claiming then go ahead and short NVDA. But donâ€™t cry when NVDA sky rockets ðŸš€",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
