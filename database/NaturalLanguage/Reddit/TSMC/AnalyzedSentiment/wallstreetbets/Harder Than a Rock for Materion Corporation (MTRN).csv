,"Recommendation: Buy Price-Target: $120 (~50% Upside) Valuation Method: 20x FY2023e Cash EPS, 13x FY2023e EV/EBITDA What Do They Do: Materion is a vertically integrated producer of high-performance advanced engineered materials used in various products across a broad array of end markets. Operating Segments: Performance Alloys and Composites - This segment operates the largest bertrandite ore mine in the world (located in Utah), which is responsible for ~70% of global beryllium supply and ~100% of N. America. This segment engineers beryllium and non-beryllium alloys used for consumer electronics, aerospace & defense, and telecom products. Advanced Materials - Produces chemicals, microelectronics, and packaging for specialty metals. Most sales in this segment are to the most prominent players within the semiconductor market. Manufactures precision thin film coatings, optical filters, and projection displays. End products are popular in aerospace & defenses, LiDAR, and autonomous driving technology. Value Proposition: MTRN plays a vital role in our large and growing technology-driven world due to its beryllium and tantalum mines and production facilities. This company screens poorly due to margins being impacted by metal pass-through costs and GAAP reporting measures, and recent acquisitions not being reflected in many analysts' expected earnings. Investment Thesis: Operates Metal Monopolies - MTRN operates the world's largest Bertrandite Ore mine, which it uses to produce beryllium. Beryllium is a metal with unique properties that make it stronger than steel yet lighter than aluminum. It has excellent thermal stability, conductivity, and transparency to x-rays. Beryllium is only produced at scale in the US (MTRN is the sole operator in this market), Kazakstan, and China. MTRN also manufactures ~40% of the global tantalum supply. Tantalum (MTRN mines are located in DR of Congo and Rwanda) is a highly durable metal that is resistant to corrosion and compatible with silicon and silicon dioxide - used for microchip processing. As technology becomes more integrated with everyday products and services (i.e., IoT), there will be an increased demand for MTRN's materials and manufacturing capabilities. When accounting for synergies, greater diversity in product offerings, and increased output, I believe EBIT margins have to potential to expand by ~200bps in FY2023. Strength of Recent Acquisitions - Optics Balzers was acquired in July 2020 for $136M (~12x LTM EBITDA). It is a precision optics company that produces thin-film optical coatings. It furthers MTRNs relationships within the lucrative aerospace & defense industry, where they serve clients such as Boeing, Airbus, and NASA. H.C. Starck Solutions was acquired in November 2021 for $380M (~13x eFY21 EBITDA). It is an industry-leading electronic materials business that is expanding its business in the fast-growing semiconductor industry. Acquisitions have been accreditive immediately and positively. Current projections have eFY2022 FCF >$70M (~$145M CFFO and $75M CapEx). Since the CEO change in 2017, gross margins have expanded by ~400bps. This expansion has been the fruit of a continuance of vertical integration. The resulting pricing power MTRN has with suppliers and buyers (metal-pass through is accounting for with Non-GAAP Value Added Sales figures discussed in Press Releases). These acquisitions have 2x MTRNs sales in APAC. This exposure is key to MTRNs inroads to key countries such as China - the fastest-growing semiconductor producer globally, S. Korea - the leading manufacturer of memory chips, and Taiwan - home of TSMC and the world's largest semiconductor water foundry. Growth on the Tailwinds of Megatrends - The new management team has aggressively grown R&D at a 16% CAGR which outpaces other advanced material providers. This move also comes hand-in-hand with changes to the working relationship MTRN has with its customers. These relationships have allowed MTRN to display its worth and capabilities to customers, which has allowed for deeper product integration. This relationship has led to some customers funding significant portions of MTRN's CapEx to expedite their production abilities, e.g., MTRN recently built a $90M Clad Strip facility that was 80% financed by one major customer. Risks: Disruptions to the Semiconductor Supply Chain. >25% of Pro-forma VAS are dedicated to semiconductor production; disruptions in this chain could negatively impact ST demand. Mitigating Factor - The underlying demand is strong and growing; while ST supply-chain woes are likely, this demand will fuel LT growth YoY. Exposure to Raw Materials. Mitigating Factor - MTRN has significant control over the global beryllium and tantalum supply chains. The other metals MTRN utilizes can be sourced from multiple international suppliers. Beryllium Exposure Litigation. Beryllium can cause Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD) and other lung conditions, resulting in injury or death if mishandled. Mitigating Factor - MTRN has a long history of mining, extracting, processing, and creating value-added materials with bertrandite and beryllium. This has allowed MTRN to develop close relationships with health and safety regulating bodies, furthering the market entry barrier. Comps: Rogers Corporation (ROG), Corning (GLW), and NGK Insulators (5333-JP) Company Background: Headquarters: Mayfield Heights, OH Founded: Origins as a mining operation in 1931 Key Leadership: CEO & President of the Board of Directors: Jugal Vijayvargiya - Took over in 2017 after spending 26 years at Delphi Automotive (where he still serves as President of Electronics and Safety) providing technological solutions in the automotive and transportation industry. Outside of the office, he serves as a director for the Greater Cleveland Partnership. He earned his BS and MS in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from The Ohio State University. Jugal has deep ties to the community and surrounding area. As a proud Buckeye and Director of a large and prominent NPO, it is evident that he plans to be in the community for the long haul. As CEO of MTRN, he has increased corporate partnerships and reinvigorated his engineers to work more closely with these partners to demonstrate the many ways MTRN can add value to their current products and future developments. CFO and VP of Finance: Shelly Chadwick (since 2020). Prior to joining MTRN Shelly spent 10 years with Timken (TKR), bearings and power transmission manufacturer located in North Canton, OH. AT TKR she served as VP of Finance and as the Chief Accounting Officer, and in various positions such as Controller and Investor Relations. Shelly's background at TKR demonstrates her knowledge in managing the financial operations for a public corporation and should provide some confidence in navigating these trying times.
