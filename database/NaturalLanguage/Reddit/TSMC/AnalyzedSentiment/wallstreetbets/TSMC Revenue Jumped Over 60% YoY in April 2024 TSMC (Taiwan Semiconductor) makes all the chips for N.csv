,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw April sales jump 60% to NT$236 billion ($7.3 billion) as sustained artificial intelligence demand was helped by the beginnings of a recovery in consumer electronics. The world’s largest contract chipmaker is estimated to increase sales by about a third in the current quarter, after revenue growth accelerated to 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by insatiable appetite for AI semiconductors. The global smartphone industry returned to growth over the first three months of the year, including in the highly competitive Chinese market, which may drive orders for TSMC’s traditional mainstay of mobile chips. Hsinchu-based TSMC weathered a year of muted demand for personal electronics last year, which Nvidia Corp.’s highly sought-after AI chips helped make more tolerable. Now the AI boost is pairing with rising prospects for consumer demand, though TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei has cautioned about the pace of any recovery. The company’s shares soared to an all-time high in April, as it remains in an enviable position to benefit from the rise of AI technology, being Nvidia’s sole manufacturer for the most advanced training chips. TSMC also fabricates semiconductors for Apple Inc., which just announced a new lineup of iPads, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the closest competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip race.

This development is only the third major shift in semiconductor design since the 1950s. Initially, we moved from planar to FinFET transistors, which reduced leakage currents significantly and enhanced power efficiency, providing a 20-30% increase in switching speeds and cutting power consumption by more than half.Now, we're transitioning from FinFET to GAA. GAA transistors offer even better gate control, further reducing leakage currents, and are expected to improve performance by over 25% compared to their FinFET predecessors. They also allow for up to 50% lower power consumption and better scalability, especially important for nodes smaller than 5nm.The front-runners in this technological leap are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.This isn't just a step forward; it's a giant leap for semiconductor technology, enhancing the capabilities of future devices and systems dramatically. For anyone skeptical about the significance or progress of these developments, consider the profound impacts that updating the structure of the core component in computing for the first time since 2000 will have on our technology landscape.Buy.",0,0.529,POSITIVE,1.0

This is why you should only buy individual stocks on companies you’ve researched well and believe in.If TSM went to 70 dollars tomorrow and it wasn’t bc of China invading I’d buy more. Bc I love the company and the product and the space seems like a good one to be invested in. But if you don’t have that kinda faith it’s hard to buy into lows and get a better cost basis.",3,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0
