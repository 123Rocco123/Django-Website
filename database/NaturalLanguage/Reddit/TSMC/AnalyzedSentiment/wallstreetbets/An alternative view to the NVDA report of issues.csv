If the problem is overheating from connecting two Blackwells side by side, spacing them out or whatever solution they find, is more like a band aid solution as opposed to a fundamentally superior approach.Re point 4, selling 1 Blackwell GPU + 1 CPU is not accelerated computing. The main product was 2 Blackwell GPUs + 1 CPU, and lots of those in a rack. The performance of 1 GPU + 1CPU wouldn't be competitive. No one would buy that.Also re point 4, it seems now almost certain that TSMC leaked it. They can't afford to have idle fabs to that scale. If Blackwell was supposed to generate $90b per year, that's $22.5b per quarter. If you use TSMC's 50% gross margin model, that's ~$10b impact to TSMC. They will be scrambling for work - hence the leak. This way, instead of calling the industry and saying we have spare capacity, the industry can call them. AMD would be high up on the list.Re point 5, apparently the gaming GPUs have also been delayed...looks more structural than a 2 week fix.There is a point 6. If you apply a negative lens for a moment, and assume Blackwell starts shipping in Q1, and Blackwell Ultra needs to be fundamentally redesigned, it will mean that AMD (from a hardware POV) will launch products before Nvidia and (again from a hardware POV) they will be superior by a margin. Of course, CUDA is important, but reputationally and brand-wise, Nvidia takes a hit. (Also, CUDA's edge is that it enables Nvidia GPUs to perform amazingly. But what if someone else's hardware is noticeably superior? Doesn't that also weaken one aspect of the whole point of CUDA?)",0,nan,nan,nan

Looks like a two week fix Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan said in the report that this is an improvement on Blackwell, not a delay: We understand that the production of the original Blackwell design began at the end of Q2 2024, and any technical issues related to the original design can still be resolved through software systems. NVIDIA hopes to further improve the stability of Blackwell by replacing some masks, that is, by ""redesigning"" it. The redesign of Blackwell has been completed at TSMC and will become a larger batch production version in Q4 2024. https://news.futunn.com/en/post/45940917/nvidia-s-new-ai-chip-release-has-been-delayed-due?level=1&data_ticket=1722696977246877","Holy shit.

The issue appears to be related to the die that connects two Blackwells together. The Blackwell chip itself is not the issue, but mass production of connecting two of them together The production issue was discovered by manufacturer TSMC, and involves the processor die that connects two Blackwell GPUs on a GB200. Nvidia is now adjusting the design and will need to run a new production test with TSMC before it can mass produce more. https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nvidia-delays-blackwell-gpus-impacting-hyperscaler-data-center-plans-report/ 4.
