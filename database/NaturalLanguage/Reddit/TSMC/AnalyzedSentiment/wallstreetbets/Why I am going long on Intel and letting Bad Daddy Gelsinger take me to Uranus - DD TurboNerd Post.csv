Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point.

AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company.

The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast. Ill link back when ever I give a shit enough to write more. Anyways I am fucking right and you know it. Source: Turbo-nerd-regard -SaucyFox",It was on my pentium sticker,1,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.956
