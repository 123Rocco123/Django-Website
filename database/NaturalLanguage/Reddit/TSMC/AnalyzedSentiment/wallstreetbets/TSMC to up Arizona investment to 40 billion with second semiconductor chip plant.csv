,nan,"Whenever anyone goes ""I have no idea where Intel is going"" I just would argue look at AMD in 2013.In the dark days AMD had Bulldozer AMD FX processors. They were awful. Completely uncompetitive, AMD had bet big on muti-threaded workloads but the IPC was awful and the design was terrible. On the GPU side, AMD was getting wrecked by the Gtx 700 series Nvidia had.AMD today is competitive in both processors and graphics cards. They first started their turnaround with the Ryzen series of processors in 2017 and the ""chiplet"" design. It wasn't perfect at first but over time it became much better. Today, the chiplet design really is not a problem.For graphics cards AMD has been the budget option and barely competitive for years. They still are in that boat, but with the Rx 6000 series they finally have their drivers sorted out and the feature set/price to performance to justify their products over Nvidia at times. They look to be continuing that with the Rx 7000 series.Intel is kind of in an odd phase themselves that is reminiscent of AMD. The Intel CPUs starting with 12th gen (2021) switched to a P core and E core design. The logic is you pair expensive and large die size performance cores with tiny crappy cores that are for heavily threaded workloads called ""efficiency cores"". It actually makes sense though, because if some program is using more than 8 cores, it tends to scale basically linearly with more cores. It's on par with AMD currently, but it's got potential and it remains to be seen who will come out ahead with their opposing styles. Meanwhile, Intel's ARC GPUs are a nightmare but exist. There's potential to grow if they just suck it up and eat the losses today. Intel does have the dominance in server CPUs with Xeon (for now, in spite of ARM/AMD eclipsing their performance) and the dominance in laptops (with AMD and Apple being much bigger threats than before).Overall, Intel is kind of in an ok position but not a dominant one.Really the entire cpu/GPU/computing sector is kind of odd right now though. Apple's M1 and M2 chips aren't there yet but they are SO close to being there. They can basically compete with x86 head to head no problem and also compete with lower end Dgpus. Meanwhile, Qualcomm just is shit as is Samsung. X86 is improving at scaling down in tdp as shown by AMD/Intel. What's gonna be the long term? x86 or ARM? Dgp+CPU or SOC? Eventually, you have to imagine that ARM is gonna takeover everything Apple based.Oddly enough I'm scared shitless of Apple if I make any processor or graphics card lol.",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Apple M1/M2 is what you get when you have an unlimited R&D budget. The power/performance is insane and this is their first shot across the bow. It would be amazing if they componentized it but they never have before and probably never will.,2,0.513,POSITIVE,0.997

,nan,"There's still a massive drain on the aquifer. CAP putting water into the ground via CAGRD is great but there's salinity problems from drawing so much water especially all the mega farms. Another major issue is electricity. These plants use massive amounts of electricity. Which require fuel pipelined in especially since coal is now considered dirty so that leaves Navajo/,Apache counties out. Not like AZ have dams to supply the electrical needs (a few.) One nuclear power plant at Palo Verde.Then the developers bought idk how many acres east of the 202 with no water rights... so they'll pay off someone to drill wells and suck that aquifer up for 2 million homes. Facebook is installing a massive server farm in that area right now by ellsworth.Water is still a major issue throughout Arizona.

,nan,Yep manufacturing chips requires a low vibration area or else they can come out flawed. So as little interference from nature as possible is ideal.

,nan,Gotta disagree with you on that one. The west is screwed as far as water and putting more manufacturing (that relies heavily on water) in the desert is an awful idea.Desal plants have a long way to go before they are viable. The byproduct kills everything so they are hard to get past environmental reviews. Plus they require a ton of energy which is primarily going to come from fossil fuel sources.The Colorado has no additional water left and at the rate the ground water is being used up that‚Äôs not going to be around for long either.Why these aren‚Äôt built somewhere like the southeast that has ample water (and is still relatively cheap) is beyond me.If you want a grim look at the future of water in the Western US take a look at the book Cadillac Desert.,1,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,I grew up watching Peter North,2,0.558,POSITIVE,0.976
,nan,"AZ is not as reliant on the Colorado river as you think. Do some real research. Groundwater and Salt + Verde river reservoirs provide most of the Central AZ water, not the Colorado river. A lot of the Colorado river water consumed by AZ is excess and is used to recharge underground aquafers by pumping it into the ground. The vast majority of Colorado river water in AZ is used for agriculture.",2,0.507,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,A good amount goes into recharging the aquifer. If you pull more water from the aquifer than you recharge (since farming is the same. People growing. Companies growing. Less share of colorador river) that means you'll be depleting it quicker. Not only does it draw it down but it also causes high salinity so the water you'd o have left is useless before it runs out.The colorado river is still a major impact on Arizona no matter what.,3,0.523,POSITIVE,0.978
,nan,"Arizonans blaming media and patting themselves on the back for thinking about future conservation is a huge problem. Vegas is way, way, way ahead of you. AZ still allows unlimited use of groundwater, wastes so much irrigation water via evaporation, and its conservation efforts are moving in slow motion. That's why Saudi Arabia built its alfalfa farms there in the first place. Once Mead hits dead pool, you'll need every drop of that groundwater.",1,0.509,POSITIVE,0.856
