,"Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs. The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value. Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes. There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples: SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings. Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x. Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap. When you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term. With the US market's P/E ratio hitting record highs despite rising bond yields, the Korean market seems like a really strong opportunity for investors concerned with valuations and looking to diversify Positions: I'm buying a lot of the etf EWY because I can't buy individual securities.

Tariffs on materials like steel makes us less competitive globally due to higher production costs, and actually makes other countries more competitive in non-US markets.We did have 4 years of the same president with hikes in tariffs from 2017-2020. Korean companies did okay during this time, other than the pandemic which crashed all economies globally.Also, If we slap tariffs on other countries, they are going to fight back with their own tariffs.Tariffs are a reason to be bearish, but I think the market's reaction of punishing international stocks while pumping US stocks to record valuations is flawed.",1,nan,nan,nan

(We are talking about people with 15 years of experience being given essentially entry level US salaries with no real path to permanent residency).There are a few companies that do offer competitive packages, like Samsung or Coupang, but they still have incredibly difficult time competing against companies in Singapore for example, where packages are more encompassing and English is widely spoken.I love living here, and it is my home, but if I had a few years of experience before I moved, I would have decided against it.",4,nan,nan,nan

My company supports relocations around the world and moving from the US to Korea would be an absolutely astronomical drop in salary although my stock grants would remain similar. So even despite the much lower cost of housing and living compared to tech hubs it’ll be quickly erased by the salary differences due to just how uncompetitive pay in tech is there compared to areas of the world that are aggressively hiring and with the funding to do so. It almost reminds me of how Germany spent years and years trying to grow its own version of Silicon Valley with various start-ups but it just never took off partly because like a lot of countries the general risk-taking nature of tech and the kinds of personalities that it tends to imply were not able to be drawn and retained there.What really is a fork in things though is that tech workers are oftentimes leaving the US now given the decline of so many things in the country on top of the absolutely brutal job market for engineers that aren’t in the top n% of cutting edge / trendy skills and connectedness. After all, software companies are trying to hire outside the US more now to avoid paying those exorbitant salaries in an effort to keep appeasing investors more interested in value than growth.",5,nan,nan,nan

In the US, we give people loans for 100% of the home value, sometimes to people with little income, which caused our 2008 housing and financial crisis. From what I read in Korea, most people do not get loans for houses, and you need to put down 50% of the property value just to rent?So unless I am missing something, how would a housing price crash impact Korean businesses or banks, since mortgages are not common?Money might be made from exports, but imports are killing the economy here. Produce is through the roof.The KRW depreciated against USD from 1100krw/usd in 2021 to 1400 krw/usd in 2024. A depreciating currency helps exports which is where the profits are.

When these leaders transfer their company shares to heirs, lower stock prices result in lower tax liabilities since taxes are calculated based on the market price at the time of transfer. This creates a major conflict of interest with individual investors, who buy stocks expecting them to rise, to add insult to injury, corporations over there do not have the obligation to maximize shareholder returns- hence little to no dividends, back door listings are common to devalue the stocks, and to maintain low valuations, tactics like “split listing” are used, where subsidiaries are listed separately to devalue the holding company. Although this practice isn’t illegal, it hinders market growth, and any tax reform favoring corporations is unlikely due to public opposition to benefiting the wealthy, hence, ironically this downward trend of stock devaluation will continue.",0,nan,nan,nan

I looked at FLKR because it supposedly had a lower Expense ratio, but it has somehow consistently underperformed EWY and has less liquidity, so I went with EWY.","There seems to be some fundamental misunderstanding here, in South Korea, influential corporate leaders have a vested interest in keeping stock prices low to reduce inheritance and gift taxes(currently tops at ~50%).They are reducing the inheritance tax.When these leaders transfer their company shares to heirs, lower stock prices result in lower tax liabilities since taxes are calculated based on the market price at the time of transfer.If their goal is to leave as much wealth to their kids as possible, I can understand temporarily depreciating market value(ie giving pessimistic guidance), but I do not understand why it would make sense to destroy long term shareholder value.to add insult to injury, corporations over there do not have the obligation to maximize shareholder returns- hence little to no dividends,I don't think these obligations would carry much weight. In the US we have this supposed mandate, but controlling shareholders still make decisions that market consensus agrees hurts shareholder returns. Zuckerburg wasting Billions on his metaverse pet project, WeWork CEO burning through Billions, Paramount controlling shareholder Redstone diluting securing a merger that benefits her at the expense of other shareholders, etc.tactics like “split listing” are used, where subsidiaries are listed separately to devalue the holding company.Is this the intended purpose? I thought it was so investors could choose which divisions to invest in. Spin-offs are quite common in the US and globally to increase shareholder value. For example Realty Income spinning off their office properties because they didn't want that baggage, HP split to HP and HPE, etc.",1,nan,nan,nan
,"Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs. The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value. Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes. There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples: SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings. Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x. Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14.

,"Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs. The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value. Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes. There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples: SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings.

Office supplies is another point. Korea makes a large chunk of exports in office machinery parts. China somehow are now gaining ground in manufacturing of office supplies of which is actually harder then it sounds. Also look at games. S korean gaming app companies used to be continually top 10 within smart phone app stores. Now none are listed within even top 10 and you can see replacements with chinese games. Same with cars, china manufactures cars that are cheaper with as much quality (at least according to some westerners that managed to get them) as any others.It really does make me sad to say it but china is absolutely fking murdering s korea. And it's especially annoying when they got there through immoral methods more so than not.",0,nan,nan,nan
,"Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs. The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value. Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes. There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples: SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings. Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x. Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap. When you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term.

It is very common for investors to seek out investments that have performed well in recent history, regardless of valuation.I think what we're seeing in Korea is just a case of performance chasing. Koreans see the US stock market price went up 4x over the past 10 years, while KOSPI is up just 17%(or negative if you go by USD price).Investors are extrapolating past performance regardless of fundamentals. And by this logic, why wouldn't you invest in the US market?We are seeing this in just about every foreign country, not just Korea. Practically every European or Canadian I talk to about investing is either just buying the S&P500/NASDAQ, or US tech stocks. I do not know any that buy their own country's market.The same logic is exactly why Koreans are also pouring tons of money into digital currencies. They see these currencies have outperformed the stock market, so they pour money into it.The overwhelming majority of US outperformance can be explained by corporate tax cuts, interest rate declines, foreign exchange rates, and rising valuations(relative to earnings). But the average retail investor is not aware of this. They just see 2 price charts, and the choice is seemingly obvious.With that said, are there risks to investing in Korea? Absolutely. This is true of literally any emerging market. But these risks are not as significant as other emerging markets such as Russia, China, Taiwan, or India.I do not understand how investors pour money into China, when the CCP has shown it does not care about foreign investors and can kill industries on a whim, and tons of corruption. But when there's an occasional scandal in Korea, people say the whole market is non-investable at any price.",1,nan,nan,nan

The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value. Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes. There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples: SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings. Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x. Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap. When you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term. With the US market's P/E ratio hitting record highs despite rising bond yields, the Korean market seems like a really strong opportunity for investors concerned with valuations and looking to diversify Positions: I'm buying a lot of the etf EWY because I can't buy individual securities. I looked at FLKR because it supposedly had a lower Expense ratio, but it has somehow consistently underperformed EWY and has less liquidity, so I went with EWY.",South Korea won’t even last a decade what are you talking about bro,0,nan,nan,nan
