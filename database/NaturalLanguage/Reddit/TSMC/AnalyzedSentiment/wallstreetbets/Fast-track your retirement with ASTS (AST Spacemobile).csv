,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues.

Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

Only the space station is a larger orbiting body. Their next iteration of satellite, Block 1 Bluebirds, have 10x the processing power of their current test satellite (Bluewalker 3), and Block 2 Bluebirds have 100x the processing power of Bluewalker 3 using their custom ASIC chip design in collaboration with TSMC which recently entered tape-out phase - Block 2 Bluebirds are on the way at 0.2% the cost per mhz of processing power compared to Bluewalker 3 ASTS INVENTED the direct-to-device market, everyone else you're hearing about jumped on board after the fact.

Spacemobiles current MNO partners have a combined 2.5billion+ subscribers. vs Starlink @ ~190million subscribers and Lynk @ 43million subscribers Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected. Gone are the days where movies rely on their characters having no phone signal for their plot to work. This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in. Now compare it to ASTS' demo streaming the AT&T commercial while their test satellite, Bluewalker 3, flew over a remote region of Hawaii on a rainy night. and also compare it to ASTS and their 4 way video call using a 14mbps 4G connection over 8 months ago. 2:00 in to their video titled ""First-Ever 5G Connectivity from Space to Everyday Smartphones Achieved by AST SpaceMobile"" on the same youtube channel as the above post.I can't link it because the link contains 3 consecutive characters of a stock you're not allowed to post about...) ""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed.

You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split.

Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite.

So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days?

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did.

Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY.

This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet.

By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.

All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs.

""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet.

By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding.

""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this.

Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ...

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding.

(Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48.

He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.

All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs.

Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet.

""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors.

Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did.

Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up.

As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here.

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.

Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.

Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile.

ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services.

No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding.

Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.I talk about a basic 5x valuation as part of the poverty scenario I painted. If we look at other trading sat companies, Iridium trades at 19x and Viasat Inc trades at 10x.This is essentially a cell tower in space, so if we also look at cell tower companies, American Tower is 25x SBA Communications Corporation is 35x.You can apply these multiples to my example where I talk about a tiny portion of the poorest subscribers.

Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors.

This image posted by AnpanMan highlights the Bluewalker 3 (current test satellite) is running a 100mhz FGPA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) chip. FPGAs are configurable integrated circuits that can be programmed to perform specific computations or processing tasks. The 100mhz clock speed determines how many operations the FPGA can potentially handle each second (100mhz = 100 million cycles per second) and gives an idea of the throughput capacity.In that same image you can see that the Block 2 Bluebird satellites will be fitted with custom ASIC chips (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) designed by ASTS in collaboration with TSMC. This will be a major leap in processing power and efficiency (100x that of Bluewalker 3). This upgrade would significantly enhance the satellite's ability to process and manage data in real-time, and supporting more advanced applications.Also, Unlike FPGAs, ASICs are designed for a specific application, which allows them to be highly optimised for their intended tasks, bringing more efficiency and speed, so we could be looking at over 100x processing power of BW3. If you're the competition and you haven't begun design on your own ASIC chips, you're already out of the race.ASTS have 128 Mbps capacity per cell and adressable capacity for production Bluewalkers is 1.8M Gb/month That's enough for:1.8billion mb / 2592000 (seconds per day in a 30 day month) = 694Mbps 694Mbps = 694,000Kbps694,000Kbps / 12.2Kbps (highest usage for 4g voice call) = 56,885 simultaneous 4G phone calls any one time per satellite.",3,0.525,POSITIVE,1.0
,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS.

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

Spacemobiles current MNO partners have a combined 2.5billion+ subscribers. vs Starlink @ ~190million subscribers and Lynk @ 43million subscribers Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed.

This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days?

He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.

All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs.

Spacemobiles current MNO partners have a combined 2.5billion+ subscribers. vs Starlink @ ~190million subscribers and Lynk @ 43million subscribers Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed.

Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.

All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs.

As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in. Now compare it to ASTS' demo streaming the AT&T commercial while their test satellite, Bluewalker 3, flew over a remote region of Hawaii on a rainy night. and also compare it to ASTS and their 4 way video call using a 14mbps 4G connection over 8 months ago. 2:00 in to their video titled ""First-Ever 5G Connectivity from Space to Everyday Smartphones Achieved by AST SpaceMobile"" on the same youtube channel as the above post.I can't link it because the link contains 3 consecutive characters of a stock you're not allowed to post about...) ""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds. No one else comes close."" u/CatSE---ApeX--- Worlds first phone call direct from space to unmodified phone (AT&T even included this milestone in their following earnings call).

Spacemobiles current MNO partners have a combined 2.5billion+ subscribers. vs Starlink @ ~190million subscribers and Lynk @ 43million subscribers Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected. Gone are the days where movies rely on their characters having no phone signal for their plot to work. This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush.

Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.

(Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed.

Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding.

Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors.

ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services.

No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

Spacemobiles current MNO partners have a combined 2.5billion+ subscribers. vs Starlink @ ~190million subscribers and Lynk @ 43million subscribers Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected. Gone are the days where movies rely on their characters having no phone signal for their plot to work. This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in. Now compare it to ASTS' demo streaming the AT&T commercial while their test satellite, Bluewalker 3, flew over a remote region of Hawaii on a rainy night. and also compare it to ASTS and their 4 way video call using a 14mbps 4G connection over 8 months ago. 2:00 in to their video titled ""First-Ever 5G Connectivity from Space to Everyday Smartphones Achieved by AST SpaceMobile"" on the same youtube channel as the above post.I can't link it because the link contains 3 consecutive characters of a stock you're not allowed to post about...) ""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.

""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet.

""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding.

Here are a few key points:Unique Business Model:AST SpaceMobile: Focuses on creating the first space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard mobile phones without any need for ground-based infrastructure. This approach can provide coverage in remote and underserved areas where traditional cellular networks are not feasible.Starlink: Concentrates on providing high-speed internet through a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites, primarily serving areas with poor internet connectivity but requiring a specialized receiver.Market Potential:AST SpaceMobile: Targets the global mobile market, which includes billions of mobile users. Its service could be especially crucial in developing regions with limited telecommunications infrastructure.Starlink: Aims at providing broadband internet services, competing with traditional internet service providers, which might limit its market to areas with poor connectivity.Partnerships and Alliances:AST SpaceMobile: Has established partnerships with major mobile network operators like Vodafone, Rakuten, and AT&T. These alliances could facilitate faster market penetration and adoption.Starlink: Operates largely independently, relying on its parent company SpaceX's capabilities.Regulatory and Operational Challenges:AST SpaceMobile: Faces challenges in regulatory approval for its satellite-to-phone technology and ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile networks.Starlink: Deals with regulatory approvals for satellite launches and ground station installations, but its model is more straightforward in terms of technology integration.Investment Considerations:AST SpaceMobile: May appeal to investors looking for exposure to innovative telecommunications solutions with potentially high rewards but also higher risks associated with new technology development and regulatory hurdles.Starlink: Backed by SpaceX, offers a more diversified risk profile due to its established space launch business, but investors might not have direct access to invest in Starlink as it is a part of SpaceX, which is privately held.Both companies offer unique value propositions, and the choice to invest in one over the other depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and belief in the long-term viability and impact of their respective technologies.",0,0.539,POSITIVE,0.906

Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48.

In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did.

Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY.

This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed.

ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS.

Give me some pessimistic scenarios! :)Edit: From the Kook ReportWhile ASTS has proven that it can connect everyday handheld cell phones to a satellite, it has yet to prove it can scale its technology across a large constellationASTS has yet to prove the specific of its business model and has a large unfunded CAPEX liabilityThe most pressing near-term risk is the Company providing visibility on its financing strategy to fund “Block 2” of its constellation. Upon deployment, Block 2 is set to push the Company toward a large positive operating cash position, but until more visibility around the financing strategy is given, investors fear the possibility of punitive dilution.ASTS also faces risk from competition, most notably SpaceX. While ASTS has secured early adoption in the form of MOUs from over 40 MOUs, the speed of innovation from SpaceX and its integrated value chain cannot be underestimated",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.992
,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds. No one else comes close."" u/CatSE---ApeX--- Worlds first phone call direct from space to unmodified phone (AT&T even included this milestone in their following earnings call).

Only the space station is a larger orbiting body. Their next iteration of satellite, Block 1 Bluebirds, have 10x the processing power of their current test satellite (Bluewalker 3), and Block 2 Bluebirds have 100x the processing power of Bluewalker 3 using their custom ASIC chip design in collaboration with TSMC which recently entered tape-out phase - Block 2 Bluebirds are on the way at 0.2% the cost per mhz of processing power compared to Bluewalker 3 ASTS INVENTED the direct-to-device market, everyone else you're hearing about jumped on board after the fact.

Spacemobiles current MNO partners have a combined 2.5billion+ subscribers. vs Starlink @ ~190million subscribers and Lynk @ 43million subscribers Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected. Gone are the days where movies rely on their characters having no phone signal for their plot to work. This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. 18:00 in. Now compare it to ASTS' demo streaming the AT&T commercial while their test satellite, Bluewalker 3, flew over a remote region of Hawaii on a rainy night. and also compare it to ASTS and their 4 way video call using a 14mbps 4G connection over 8 months ago. 2:00 in to their video titled ""First-Ever 5G Connectivity from Space to Everyday Smartphones Achieved by AST SpaceMobile"" on the same youtube channel as the above post.I can't link it because the link contains 3 consecutive characters of a stock you're not allowed to post about...) ""I never see these posts till the run has happened"" Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos. I get most of my DD from these far more intelligent and knowledgable sources. They're able to understand a lot more of the technical side of what's going on and translate that for everyday retail investors to understand.

Add to that that ASTS are literally inventing all of the solutions to solve problems thought to be impossible to beat, and then encountering new problems as they go which hadn't even been thought of yet, only to invent solutions for those too - hence their insanely large portfolio of patents.ASTS also faces risk from competition, most notably SpaceX.While on the subject of patents: SpaceX is the only competitor offering anything near to a comparable service. I personally wouldn't even call it competition when you look at them side by side - SpaceX is a horse and ASTS is a car - but for arguments sake let's say they both offer the same service. If you search ""SpaceX + Omnispace"" you'll see that SpaceX are having serious issues with their beamforming. They are broadcasting in to the spectrum assigned to Omnispace and interfering with their satellites. To help remedy this they then asked the FCC to allow them to lower the altitude of their satellites below that of the ISS - FCC said there's no chance of that happening. SpaceX asked Omnispace to share their spectrum. Omnispace said no and things between them have become heated. SpaceX have now gone crying (yesterday) to the FCC asking them to change their original application to allow thousands of their signal-leaking satellites. They're doing everything except come up with a technical solution... because they simply can't work out a solution. A solution, by the way, that ASTS have researched, solved, and yes... patented.Only low bandwidth, will they be able to monetize this enough?A huge chunk of market resides in lowband. So much so that there's no way ASTS would even be able to fully address it - whatever they have to sell, will be bought. Also, I can't find the source for you right now but I remember it was calculated that the satellites (Bluewalker 3) have something like 2800 beams for lowband and 20,000 beams for midband, and the ability to tune in to C-band, but I have no further details on that.ASTS has yet to prove the specific of its business model and has a large unfunded CAPEX liabilityLack of cash / possible future dilutionThe most pressing near-term risk is the Company providing visibility on its financing strategy to fund “Block 2” of its constellation.Lack of cash is a real concern, and the possibility of dilution is also real, but they also have a lot of promising avenues for revenue, be it non-dilutive funds and revenues (such as the Fairwinds US Department Of Defense contract), more signed definitive agreements, or grants. The Rural 5G $9billion grant has long been discussed as the golden goose for ASTS, as they are the only ones with a solid viable and cost efficient solution... if they can pull it off.While ASTS has proven that it can connect everyday handheld cell phones to a satellite, it has yet to prove it can scale its technology across a large constellationThis is the real one for me. You asked what my bear case is, and this is it.That and the rocket exploding on launch. Though all launches are insured and they would get their losses back, it would delay them significantly - further losing their first-to-market lead.One thing you didn't mention, and other bear cases arguments do, is regulatory constraints. SpaceX are having an awful time with their D2D offering and the FCC, but ASTS have been coasting through so far. I mention in my post that since the Department of Defense badly wants this tech, I don't see the FCC blocking it.I think the FCC hearing directly related to ASTS that everyone has been waiting for is on the 13th of this month? you might need to fact check me on that, but I'll certainly be tuning in. It's something institutional investors have had reservations about, so when we get over that hurdle I'm sure we'll see some good price action as a result.To add a point addressing the ""lack of cash"" issue, while writing this I just saw this post on LinkedIn by Dan Askew (UK military) talking about an upcoming event to discuss ""NATO's future SATCOM program"" alongside ASTS... more military revenue? $$$",1,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors. Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors. Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada.

,"They said the tech doesn't exist because it isn't possible they invented and have proven the tech. They said the satellite would not unfold. “The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.” (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022) legs spread wide with no issues. They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. “The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.” (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022) The satellite is #solid as a rock# They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution “When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?” (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022) It's cool as a cucumber and solution patented ""ASTS has proven the viability of its technology, which was previously thought to be an impossible challenge and is set to address three hurdles largely within its control: financing its constellation, securing U.S. regulatory approval, and finalizing its initial commercial agreements"" -The KOOK Report (Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here) Financing it's constellation - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail. U.S. regulatory approval - U.S. Department of Defence has already paid ASTS $500k to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected.

This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? More discussion around this speculation can be found here. But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s recent post on WSB, each of which will give the SP a nice bump I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time. Finilasing it's commercial agreements - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE. Not just because they're inking revenue, but because they own adjacent spectrum, as well as FirstNets additional low band spectrum, they're more capable of penetrating walls and other obstacles and provide continuous service: ""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars?? Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol... ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current satellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be able to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases that were previously cost-prohibitive -The KOOK Report Why aren't AST Spacemobile known? You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite. Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions. You don't need the latest iphone for this.

Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world. There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario. Typical wsb responses ""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS"" -_____- ... ""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time"" ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. Around 1:12:00 for the cream. ""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up"" Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over. ""SpaceX can just buy them out"" Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share. ""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run"" The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue. ""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX"" The Starlink offering was touted as 17mbps, with a 15% packet loss, and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area.

I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion) Latest speculation: Earlier this month, AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS.
