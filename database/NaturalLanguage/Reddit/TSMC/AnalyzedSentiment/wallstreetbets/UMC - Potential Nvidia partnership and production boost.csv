,"Hey guys, Flair should be right, it’s more a discussion of a regarded idea than an actual DD ! I'm really excited about Nvidia today, not so much for Nvidia itself, but for the potential knock-on effects it could have on other companies. Nvidia has a big problem: production. TSMC can't keep up with demand, and this is where UMC could come in. I think it's possible that Nvidia will soon announce a production partnership with UMC, which could send UMC's stock price soaring in the next day or so. I just opened a small position in UMC (ADR), A0M2R4. ($UMCB) This is just a loose idea and I don't have any deep insights or anything other than this article: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/analysts-unveil-new-nvidia-price-targets-as-key-earnings-report-looms However, I think the risk is manageable due to the lack of leverage. What’s your opinion on this monke brain idea? P.S. This is not financial advice, I'm just a monke who can press buttons!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Could be wrong on that.In any case TSMC's 4nm process is in the H100 and with the H200 coming I don't see how UMC helps in any way when they cant make the 4nm nodes Nvidia uses. Maybe they fill a role somewhere in the Nvidia product line but this play makes no sense to me. Nvdia needs TSMC to scale in order to print those chips my dude. Do your research here to make sure but seems like a monke brain idea.,0,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0

This is a massive play. When it will hit? Not sure but it’s inevitable IMO.,0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.72

This sector isn’t my forte but I’ve been eyeing UMC and lost on how they are trading at 8 dollars a share and have been around for a long time. Are they carrying massive debt? I like their dividend even though it’s annual. do you think it’s a buy? besides DGRO and VOO I’m not holding any individual tech/chip stocks.,1,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.954
