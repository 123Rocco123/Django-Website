,"TL/DR $ASTS is a volatile stock that popped and then dropped, and is likely to do that again. 📈📈📉🔂 Following a formal agreement with AT&T AST SpaceMobile shares rose rapidly with ~ +100% to then give back almost half. Short interest did not change much. From around 40.8 Mn shares shorted 05/17 to 37.4 shares shorted 05/23. The agreement was significant news to the company and the reaction came with a record volume traded. Sharp increase of SP yet most shorts are still there. There are a few more catalysts that are about the same size remaining: • First Net formal agreement. • Delivery of the first 5 satellites to Space-X. • EXIM financing • Delivery & testing of ASICs chips from TSMC for the next gen sats. • Regulatory clearance from the FCC for US market access. • News of the test results through Fairwinds DoD contract. • Converting some of the rest of the 49 MoUs with Mobile Network Operators into pre-paid formal agreements like the AT&T deal. • Rural 5G fund grant. If some/any of these catalysts materialize the short interest is pretty much intact near record levels and a similar spike and cool-off is likely to occur again like the one we just saw. There are also technological and businessmodel aspects to $ASTS worth discussing. But right now the market shys from that subject and focuses on funding and execution risks.

So the spectrum holdings of Verizon and AT&T are spatially complementary and solves a regulatory and a coverage issue.A win-win-win deal.Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.No one else comes close.In a way it is yet another confirnation from a major player they belive in the tech.And then there is the funding risk / dillution fear that this deal obliterates. They bring USD 100 Mn to the table. That buys a lot of very profitable satellites.In the US American Towers will build the gateway sites for AST. AST will lease them. This terrestrial infrastructure needs not to be duplicated to serve both carriers. The only thing doubling is the revenue stream for AST. Not the costs.",1,0.528,POSITIVE,0.87

Company burns about 40M per quarter in operations and has no revenue in the last 15 months.The 100M from Verizon is 65M in commercial prepayments (I am guessing this is revenue) and 35M in convertible notes (senior equity, both dilutive and ahead of common in liquidation). The partnership extends runway about 1.5 quarters. Without additional revenue, the company will keep issuing stock for cash, probably in a year to 18 months.Verizon contract is a good step for the company for sure. But in terms of long plays it's far from a sure thing. Keep in mind it was a SPAC, so maybe not the most ready for the public markets (i.e. too young) during its volatile early days.This is venture investing, not a mature public company.

,"TL/DR $ASTS is a volatile stock that popped and then dropped, and is likely to do that again. 📈📈📉🔂 Following a formal agreement with AT&T AST SpaceMobile shares rose rapidly with ~ +100% to then give back almost half. Short interest did not change much. From around 40.8 Mn shares shorted 05/17 to 37.4 shares shorted 05/23. The agreement was significant news to the company and the reaction came with a record volume traded. Sharp increase of SP yet most shorts are still there. There are a few more catalysts that are about the same size remaining: • First Net formal agreement. • Delivery of the first 5 satellites to Space-X. • EXIM financing • Delivery & testing of ASICs chips from TSMC for the next gen sats. • Regulatory clearance from the FCC for US market access. • News of the test results through Fairwinds DoD contract. • Converting some of the rest of the 49 MoUs with Mobile Network Operators into pre-paid formal agreements like the AT&T deal. • Rural 5G fund grant. If some/any of these catalysts materialize the short interest is pretty much intact near record levels and a similar spike and cool-off is likely to occur again like the one we just saw. There are also technological and businessmodel aspects to $ASTS worth discussing. But right now the market shys from that subject and focuses on funding and execution risks. And so I will not go into those aspects. I did some DD and they’re good, there, imo. 🛰️=💰 The main focus - and the shorts thesis - are on funding and execution risks at the moment. And catalysts are stacking up to disprove those fears. AT&T and Google are the latest strategic investors. American Tower, Vodafone and Bell Canada are onboard since long. Nokia provides the cellular base-station. Disclosure: Holding 77,777 shares. No options.
