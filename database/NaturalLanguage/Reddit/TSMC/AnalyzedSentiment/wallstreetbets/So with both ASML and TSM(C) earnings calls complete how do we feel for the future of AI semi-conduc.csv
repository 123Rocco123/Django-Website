,"So as the title implies, how do you feel about the future of AI/semi-conductor companies or the market as a whole? I mean we had this huge upheaval/hype in companies that are developing AI (generative) or produces advanced semi-conductor chips that facilitates the AI's processing capabilities. Yet, despite ASML/TSM earnings, hitting their targets, guidance weren't as aloof or exciting as NVDA/MSFT/GOOGL made it out to be for AI. It also seemed like they didn't see any short-term demand explosively grow. Should we take it as it'll be just some time needed to develop the market similar to the hype around TSLA/EV's in 2020-2021? Or was all this hype surrounding AI merely just a short term cash grab and soon a correction will come kind of like the one that happened with EV's back in 2021. Don't get me wrong, I do believe that AI will be a huge boon to the economy in the long run, but I feel that the sentiment and hype around it have been way overblown.
