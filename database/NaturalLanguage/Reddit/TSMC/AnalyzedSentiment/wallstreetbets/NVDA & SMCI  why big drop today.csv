,"NVDA was around $888 and SMCI around $1,120 today morning at about $9:40am. Both stocks and all semiconductor stocks are down bigly suddenly in last 25-30 minutes. So, what happened? I heard on CNBC that ASML, the Dutch semiconductor maker missed the earnings because of order slowdown from Samsung and TSMC. The ASML stock crashed and went down $67 or about 7%. And, almost all semiconductor stocks including NVDA, SMCI, AMAT etc went down about 2-3% in sympathy. IMO, this is overreaction and has nothing to do with NVDA and SMCI. Being a risk taker, I just bought lot of ITM calls when NVDA was down at $862 and SMCI at $974. I think, both should recover provided no other bad news comes! What y‚Äôall think?

That means there is no slowdown in NVDA demand. IMO, Nvidia will again blowout earnings and raise the expectations. Also, if you remember SMCI raised more than $1.6B recently by selling shares so they can buy more chips from Nvidia to build more servers.Let‚Äôs see how TSMC earnings come tonight.
