,"AMD, NVIDIA or Intel right now? Thoughts, Opinions, Predictions, etc all welcome - This is not an advise post, just a pick your brain and let me see what the community thinks before I personally choose one of them to dump into. Thoughts between them below, given the recent 4090 BS, EVGA partnership loss, AMDs supposed amazing GPUs coming soon, Intel's upcoming chips, etc. I think AMD is going to come out strong toward the end of this year into next year - Between the BS nvidia has done with the 40 series and the (hopefully) amazing price to performance that amd is reportedly bringing, plus the uplift the new ryzen chips are getting compared to intel.... yeah i feel like AMD is in a position to really increase it's market share by massive amounts on both fronts. I don't see a recovery plan for NVIDIA right now given the inflation and TSMC price increases ontop of the cost to produce the 40 series AND the backlog of 30 series cards lol.... As for Intel, eh idk i just feel like ryzen is going to top the charts this time around and intel will struggle to keep up - In regards to price to performance specifically, but that is left to be seen.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

However, it gives me a dividend while waiting and the PE is low. They are investing in a foundry. Having said that, it keeps crashingðŸ˜¬",0,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.997

Also think itâ€™s interesting that while AMD and NVDA are scrambling after these latest restrictions that intel is way ahead of them and invested 26 billion into building US manufacturing sites, last year. Iâ€™m actually considering scooping up a couple hundred shares myself",1,0.563,NEGATIVE,0.962

Discretionary consumer PC CPU spend is immaterial. The hobby PC builder market equates to like... almost nothing at least from a profit and growth perspective... Certainly the consumer sentiment you're likely picking up is of low value.All the juice is in server and integrated.

Especially for the remaining decade.Both NVDIA and AMD are practically Asian companies although they are technically US companies. But they rely so much on Asia for production that they could be ripped apart by the change of wind in regards of US politics.I could imagine that both of them have to produce chips in Intel fabs later this decade. Beside that I'm sure that harsh times with Asia will demise both more than Intel. For me Intel is something like Lockheed Martin or Boeing.Further Intel is already beaten down, so even if they would drop with overall market another 20%, this would still be better than a high PE Nvidia and AMD, who are both valued for perfect execution. And how do you want to execute perfect in such harsh times?So good luck to everyone, but I'm sticking with Intel. I think Meteor Lake will be the turning point and if so investing afterwards will be too late. If Intel hits 50 dollar again, it is in my opinion too late.",0,0.553,NEGATIVE,0.998
