,nan,"The market determined inflation was transitory. Interest rates went up, stocks never went down to account for a higher discount rate.Then the market anticipated that the Fed was going to cut rates, so the market went way up.Then the market figured out they were wrong, that inflation is still here, the rate cuts aren't happening, and the whole thing was a charade.",2,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.982

,nan,"at this point we're just giving excuses when we all know it's rigged, or is ""priced in"" the code word for ""rigged""?",3,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Beat expectations due to strong AI chip demand despite softening demand in core business units such as auto and smartphones.Today, a business reliant on the growth of AI demand is a lot more risky than one that relies on the growth of smartphone/auto demand.If you believe this AI demand to be real and lasting, you’d be piling into TSMC on any dip after this earning.",3,0.57,POSITIVE,0.969
,nan,That's dumb af. The very notion of that is dumb.What are we investing in stocks for.Make profit go down. Gtfo,4,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"The market doesn’t give a fuck about today’s profits. It’s all about forward guidance kiddo.And when the company tells you straight to your face that their growth is all because of a new, not fully proven or mature, product category while their core business is dragging—you better listen.If AI becomes the only source of growth, the US or EU governments could regulate TSMC’s death if they wanted to. They could severely cap AI’s use and undercut demand for AI server chips. Then all the sudden there is no more growth and TSMC’s future is looking grim.Sorry, that was more than twenty words so I’m sure I lost you. Enjoy your bags though.",5,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,"It was a serious beat for HPC chips if you actually read report, their iPhone chips were down and the substantial increase in demand for HPC offset it and caused profit, you'll see in a few days when the market actually digests the news",2,0.549,POSITIVE,0.784
,nan,Or the market is taking into consideration the risky position TSMC is now in with having those HPC chips be their growth engine while other core areas are showing signs of decline.Transitions are the most risky time for investors of established companies. Either TSMC continues to see strong AI demand and dominates as they transition or there is a slip in demand and suddenly they are drowning under poor return on capital expenditures and stagnating revenues.,3,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,How would they show signs of decline? Other chips are cyclical they have been for the last decade and the street knows that,4,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.88
,nan,GPT-REEEE,5,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,Not my area so not sure what data they look at but but TSMC’s formal guidance for the auto sector last earnings was demand growth. They switched that to now having forward guidance of a decline in auto chip demand which is a tough switch to make in just one quarter.They also called out a sharper than expected decline in smartphone demand. So it sounds like whatever they are seeing is enough to say it’s outside the standard cyclical demand seasonality.,5,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.996

,nan,145 Ap 26th calls Rip. Option trading is over for me. TSM gives me ptsd.,0,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.989
,nan,"The TLDR of the earnings:AI chip demand is very strong. AI Server business is growing to become a larger piece of revenue. Should be 20% in a year or two by 2028 (seems conservative to me tbh).Other chip areas are declining (edit: partially due to seasonality but sounds like some beyond expectations). Auto chip demand is now forecasted to shrink versus expand. Smartphone sales slowdown is dragging on their smartphone chip line as well.Investing tons of capital into advanced technologies for mainly the AI space.Geopolitical risks remain high.In summary, they are doing well to transition the business to satisfy AI chip demand. However, areas of their core business today are seeing softening demand. This puts TSMC in a highly precarious position as continued AI demand means dominance while any slip could spell disaster given the high capital expenditures and receding core business areas in smartphone/auto.",0,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.992
,nan,"People say auto go down. Who cares about.It's like saying we're worried Jensen hasn't realesed the 5090 ti rtx.Nobody buying nvida for consumer gpus or crypto for that matter.And while auto contracts, robots and drones are on the rise.",1,0.501,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,People sayWell in this case it was literally TSCM that commented on their switch in demand guidance from positive growth to negative decline. I personally think any major pullback due to that is overblown seeing as their auto business is only 6% of revenue. I’m just sharing the pieces of core guidance that stood out including both positive and negative. No need to get cult-ish in defense of a stock.,2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Was the guidance not good enough compared to expectations or something?,0,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,"Guidance for the AI demand was very strong. But they switched to a negative sentiment around their auto chips and got more negative about future smartphone demand than they were before.So instead of “Everything is growing including this new product category called AI!” it was “This new product category called AI is crushing it that it makes the top line look great!…please do not look behind the curtain at the rest of the business.”Good news for any pure/mostly AI players, not so great news for any more traditional chip makers.",1,0.563,POSITIVE,0.677

,nan,I believe with so many calls being bought they expire 4/19 these that are covering those calls made sure the stock didn’t spike. You could see it trying for a month. Up $5 then down. Even in the same day. Once tomorrow passes and they collect their massive amount of money and everyone with the calls loses then the stock will rebound. Next week you’ll start seeing it head to $155-160. Then it’s too late for us who bought in.
