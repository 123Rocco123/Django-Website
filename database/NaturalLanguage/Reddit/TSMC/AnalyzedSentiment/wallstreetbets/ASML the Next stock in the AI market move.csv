There maybe delays as it gets production ramped up as TSM and others evaluate and work through kinks Now let’s look at the stock: It’s at all time highs and isn’t cheap with a PE of 44 (vs 75 for NVDIA). Note it actually have a dividend yield at .68%. So the metrics are a little expensive but not really stretched. I expect their next earnings call (April 17) to be a huge catalyst as 2na adoption is discussed TLDR: These guys have the shit every chip mfg is going to have to have to compete for the most advanced AI processors and memory. This is a “shovels and mortar” play for AI and will be a slower stock rise than others but should see another 50% in the next year as people see 2na chip machines get bought. Near term catalyst is April 17 earnings call. Note: there are real risks with chip tech this advanced.

ASML products might be used in every high end chip manufactured but the same applies to AMAT, LRCX, KLAC, and 1000 other companies. The semiconductor industry is full of specialised suppliers with zero competitors which are indispensible to the manufacturing process.I suggest OP research the semiconductor market before making these posts.",0,0.536,POSITIVE,0.999
