,nan,Chipmakers are a cyclical business. In a cyclical business it's usually a bad sign to have low PEs because it usually is a sign of oversupply coming soon. It was already expected for oversupply to hit the market in 2023 with the new supply being build and shortages in all places. With slowing demand now we would hit double headwinds. I would wait until the end of 2023. I don't think it's a bad time to buy now for the long term but it's probably more pain coming.,0,0.554,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,oversupply? tsmc capacity is 100% booked,1,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.991
,nan,"not exactly this QTSMC clients big and small have been slashing orders, which will become clear in the 4th quarter as production slows, media report. 5nm and 28nm processes will remain hot, but 7nm, more mature node utilization will fall to 90%, slip more in Q1 2023.",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,the demand for old processes always drops when a better one comes out. the old ones get then get repurposed for making random stuff.why would anyone want a 65nm chip instead of 5nm or the upcoming 3nm next year.old processes can make flash memory and bullshit non important / state of the art chips,3,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"That’s not true - the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing is on old nodes. 40nm is the last “normal” node and it’s where the vast majority of semiconductors will eventually end up. There is a huge amount of demand at 40, 65 and 90nm for everything that isn’t the latest flashiest technology - I.e the stuff that runs the entire world.For the vast majority of semiconductors made there is nothing that will justify shrinking under 40 which requires masks that are significantly more expensive and you still have to bond the package to the die which means your die has to be at minimum the size required for lead bonding. This means going under 40 is only meaningful for advanced technologies - not your run of the mill electronics used to run things.",4,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,"28 is becoming pretty normal too. It looks like 7, 28, 65, and 130 will be the ""evergreen"" nodes going forward. However, 7 nm hasn't quite reached the point where it's cheap enough to get anything but people chasing the leading edge.",5,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,The biggest problem is the cost of design for 28 process is significantly more than 40nm and unless the part complexity justifies it you could end up with the same actual die size due to bonding requirements with no advantages. So I think 40nm is just going to keep growing in demand as products end up shrinking to the last node before peoples entire design process changes.40 is pretty much the smallest you can go with conventional photomasks so it’s basically the last stop for an absolute ton of semiconductors. But for sure 28 will be really popular for advanced products going forward as will 65 for shrinks of true legacy parts. I can’t imagine anything staying over 100 except for analog and rf heavy devices.People obviously get super excited about these crazy tiny nodes at 3 and 7 but forget about all the boring parts that are needed to make the world run.Really big and complicated parts on advanced nodes can end up with yield problems that lower your margins - something at a legacy node with 96% yield can rake in really nice margin for a fab. Not all of the yield problems can get passed to your customer.TSMC is really a long term winner if they continue to build out fabs with capabilities at these highly demanded “evergreen” nodes. They just need to keep it measured so they don’t end up with overcapacity during the impending downturn.,6,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,We are talking TSM 7nm here. Your laptop probably uses it.,4,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.823
,nan,Yes oversupply will hit. It doesn't mean it already hit. Shortages started in mid 2020 since then TSMC has 100% capacity used. How much do you think they started building in terms of factories? Everyone knows these plans.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Construction-of-TSMC-s-U.S.-chip-plant-delayed-by-labor-crunch-COVIDIntel also currently build a ton of new factories planned to go live a bit after.So as a business owner would you buy all your chips in 2023 or wait until the new more modern ones hit? That means CEOs will reduce buying until new more modern ones hit and on top of that companies are hit with lower demand because of macro. So two very good reasons not to spend your money in 2023 but wait for 2024. The shortages also caused a form of stockpiling which leaves a lot of companies with inventories of chips currently. In 2024 once the new chips come out it will be a frenzy. In theory 2023 should be a very bad year but who knows. China sanctions are starting again. This might lower the blow and create short term demand until the new factories start running. It's just very risky now but also not a problem long term as 2024 will very likely surpass todays numbers but 2023 is at best a very volatile time.,2,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"improvements come out every year. you’d end up not buying anything. why would you buy chips on a 2024 process when 2025 is coming out.its not easy to build a new fab so tsmc didnt actually ramp up capacity due to high demand, they always built new fabs for the newer production process",3,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.948
,nan,It's not me just saying this. It's what was happening in the past. Nobody buys the current top tier stuff if they know in a year new top tier stuff hits that's way better.You can do what you want. I'm just saying that's the historical reason it's a bad time to be in semis in 2023. I also said it's not a bad time to buy now for the long term if you can handle more downside in the short term.I'm sorry but you literally don't know what you're talking about. Improvements don't come out every year. Improvements come out about every 2-3 years currently but also did take longer in the past. US literally spend money to incentivize a ton of new factories in US and TSMC said themselves that they would build new fabs due to shortages.Edit: here's your roadmap about improvements every year.https://images.anandtech.com/doci/17452/tsmc-roadmap-june-2022.png,4,0.586,NEGATIVE,0.994

,nan,This is showing the chart over 7 years. Was this a 7 year cycle? Calling this cyclical doesn’t make sense to me.,1,0.572,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Are you people serious. It's not that I invented this stuff it's common knowledge everywhere besides apparently here. This is the stock price which doesn't mean much. For TSMC the cycle recently was 2-3 years. You can see it in the earnings of those companies. Those look kinda wavy. 2020-2021 should have been a bad earnings time but it wasn't as bad this time because of shortages but you can still see it. Once you zoom out you cannot see those effects because they become to small in the long run. Those cycles also become shorter and less bad in the last years so people speculate if they will soon lose their cyclical nature because more stable demand industries like servers use them more but it's just a theory for now.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSM/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing/eps-earnings-per-share-dilutedYou see those red yoy quarterly growth bars at the bottom. That's the cycle. Jesus that you literally have to explain basic stuff here.,2,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Gotcha, your trying to explain why it’s going up and down within a 1-2 year period when none of that would matter if you bought early on and just held for 5-6 years. That being said, no one is here to hold a stock multiple years. finding the cycle stocks helps you though make your bets.",3,0.59,POSITIVE,0.657
,nan,Correct. If you buy now I don't think you will be unhappy if you wait until 2024 or 2025 but if want to make fast money in 2-5 months I don't think it's good time now because earnings most likely will take a hit and demand may slow on top. There's also another thing that may throw this whole regular thing out of the window as Nvidia chips are about to get sanctioned which would mean china probably buys as much as possible until Q2 next year. It's the best short term bet but you basically have a negative and a positive force fighting for the stock so very volatile and risky.,4,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.996

The demand/market for highend chips artificially shrinks, therfore the pricing power of chipmakers. Furthermore, china will push even harder to create its own worldleading chipmanufacturers. Sure, it will take time, but I bet in 7 or 10 years they will reach our level, or maybe even better.
