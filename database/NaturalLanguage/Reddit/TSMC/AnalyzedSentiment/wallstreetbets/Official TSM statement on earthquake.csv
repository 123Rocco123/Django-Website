,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,"TLDR: hold onto your putsBeen working in the semiconductor industry in for a few years now. While it is good that the EUV tools are unharmed, this letter does not mention how much scrap the earthquake caused (which won‚Äôt be public anyways, more of a customer conversation). For those unfamiliar, wafers take ~3+ months to completely process through a fab. At certain points in the line, wafers can get scrapped due to excessive waiting (queue time) for the next step from native oxide growth. With 20% of unspecified tools down, I expect a lot of scrap from the tools impacted directly during the quake and in the queue time aftermath. This isn‚Äôt like a normal manufacturing line where shutting a tool down temporarily is manageable. In the semiconductor world, it‚Äôs a lot harder.There‚Äôs a lot of other things I could mention about what could be going wrong right now with these fabs because there are SO MANY moving parts, but a 3 paragraph letter doesn‚Äôt cover the extent of it. Yes, TSMC is prepared for earthquakes, but you can only prepare so much. One gas line rupture and the whole fab can get taken out. Quality will take a hit. Production output will take a hit. Plan accordingly.",0,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.983
,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,"I'm no expert but I read that even ""mere"" vibrations being felt in a clean room can actually cause significant damage and defects in wafers, then again I would imagine it depends on how effective and reactive their anti-earthquake systems are. Any more insights on this? Or would it be exaggerated to think the impact could be significant?",1,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.998
,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,"That can be true, I‚Äôve heard of install equipment causing defects. Most places will have seismic dampening for that purpose, especially as a lot of fabs are built in clusters so construction adjacent to the fab would be impactful. However a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and nearby construction are very different. Idk what kind of preparation TSMC has, but I hope it‚Äôs good.",2,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,"Yeah 20% is fucking wild especially considering it isn't necessarily 20% of lines like people in other industries would think, but could be instead the same 20% of every single line which would actually be a fairly reasonable thing to happen since similar tools would fail in similar ways.Plus yeah the safety hazards of an earthquake in a fab are not something I'd like to think about at all. Like do you re-qualify every single gas line in the fab for leaks? Do you just assume anything that didn't alarm is fine? It's not something I would want to deal with.",1,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,"Meh, it's certainly a production loss, but to address your points:Excessive wait time is simply resolved by repeating an HF-dipSome tools will fail and cause scrap, but most processes (>80%) can be recovered/reworkedWafers in processes compared to idle are very minimalGas line ruptures are really not expectedI've been through fab interruptions related to power dips, certainly not as impactful as earthquakes, but I can only imagine the contingency plan for earthquake prone factories are a lot stronger. Any loss higher than 1% would really surprise me.",1,0.512,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,Droughts are nothing compared to earthquakes too. Like droughts just mean you have to turn some equipment off in a controlled manner. Earthquakes mean random shit is getting fucked up.,1,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.964

,Seems everything is mostly operarational asside from some small damages to some tools,"Oh for sure I just mean that the problems caused by that are going to be different than those caused by an earthquake. Like if the government tells TSMC ""We need to cut your water supply"" then they can shut things down in a controlled manner. When the equipment turns back on it needs to be requalified for things like particles but it's not that bad aside from the lost production time.For an earthquake though? Now you are talking about uncontrolled shutdowns, components that have been physically damaged, dangerous chemicals that may or may not find exciting ways to leak etc. Not only that but the problems caused by an earthquake are going to be different from the problems they normally have to troubleshoot. Like for example if a piece of equipment goes down for preventative maintenance and then doesn't pass qual when it comes back up you have a good frame of reference for what needs to be investigated. If it goes down during processing you have lots of logs and historical data you can compare to to isolate the cause and also you can rule out a ton of stuff that wouldn't just suddenly go bad during processing. An earthquake on the other hand is a giant question mark for what is actually broken, and every tool hitting problems at the same exact time is a nightmare.",3,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.985
