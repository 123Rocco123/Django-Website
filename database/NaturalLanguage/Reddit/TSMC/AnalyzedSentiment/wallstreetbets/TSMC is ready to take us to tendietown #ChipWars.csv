,"Bois, I've spent my morning on big brain thinking and drew a strategy with crayons on my wall. The market believes in GenAI and from my miniscule tendie focused vantage point I don't have any reason to disagree. A few very basic observations: Who has the necessary IP to build chips needed for training and serving LLMs? Nvidia, Google, Apple Who can produce the required chips at scale? TSMC Who builds the machines to produce these chips? ASML If LLM inference was further optimized to not require state of the art accelerator chips, who else could supply? Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries Time for some hedge fund level deep market analysis: What stands out: We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML) Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted With competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have. TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market. Now you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk. Right. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production? All of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down. So 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities. China has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low. That leaves TSMC priced at a ~50% discount.

They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have. TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market.

They’re also expanding into the US with the plant in Arizona.However, the US is also investing 10s of billions into US chip manufacturing companies. You’re telling people to buy the Marlboro of chip manufacturing and expecting it to run another 50% after it just caught up to its pandemic high?

TSMC Who builds the machines to produce these chips? ASML If LLM inference was further optimized to not require state of the art accelerator chips, who else could supply? Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries Time for some hedge fund level deep market analysis: What stands out: We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML) Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted With competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have. TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market. Now you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk. Right. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production? All of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down. So 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities. China has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low. That leaves TSMC priced at a ~50% discount.

Checkout geohot's short stint into trying to make AMD GPUs work for this if you want to know more.Intel has it's own foundry and is therefore capable of producing it's own designs and those of the other IP holders.Apple has one of the largest device install bases in the world. Apple has been heavily investing into making LLMs run on their chips. Apple chip designs are beating everyone else in FLOP/w and their unified memory architecture is basically perfect for LLMs. Apples devices hold the key needed to make GenAI super valuable for consumers: all of their personal data.

A few very basic observations: Who has the necessary IP to build chips needed for training and serving LLMs? Nvidia, Google, Apple Who can produce the required chips at scale? TSMC Who builds the machines to produce these chips? ASML If LLM inference was further optimized to not require state of the art accelerator chips, who else could supply? Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries Time for some hedge fund level deep market analysis: What stands out: We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML) Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted With competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have. TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market. Now you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk. Right. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production? All of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down. So 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities. China has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low. That leaves TSMC priced at a ~50% discount. Fellow wendy workers, we have an opportunity to go beyond YOLO-ing again. Who's in? Disclaimer: this is not investment advice. I dre",AMD does produce via GlobalFoundries and oh wait.... TSMC. That makes my case above even stronger if you believe AMD has any actual relevant IP in order to compete.I don't think AMD has leverage in the LLM game today but happy to learn otherwise :),3,0.574,POSITIVE,0.999
