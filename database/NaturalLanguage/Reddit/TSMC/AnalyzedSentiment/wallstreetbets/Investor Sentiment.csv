,nan,Didnâ€™t intel just report 7 billion in operational loss in chipmaking? So pretty much lost it all?,0,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"Yeah, I think the grant was closer to $8.5 billion. The $7 billion figure is actually their operating loss from their foundry business last year, lol. I got them confused.",1,0.581,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,That was specifically for their foundry services which is understandable since that is still fairly new and they are still trying to establish it. They lost money on it the previous year too the main difference is that they are specifically separating it in how they are reporting their financials now.,1,0.573,NEGATIVE,0.984

,nan,FYI: You don't usually accumulate interest on the funds stored under your pillow (check with your pillow provider),5,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.937
,nan,"FYI: most people wouldnâ€™t be interested in the stock market if they could just grow their savings in a high yield savings account or bond, because itâ€™s simple. Wallstreetbets exists almost solely because of low interest rates that inflated the stock market prices and increased volatility. With high interest rates people would just put their money under the mattress (in the bank) and make gains on the interest and it would make them money because inflation would be lower than the interest rate.",6,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.874
,nan,"Intel has been working on sub 10nm chips for nearly a decade... meanwhile AMD be...And then when you look into how shady the company is... like putting their CPUs inside of a commercial freezer so they can beat AMDs on bench marks and uh...Feels like another IBM, RCA, KodakI mean in 10 years who knows but I keep seeing these ads suggesting you need Intel chips for AI and I vomit in my mouth a little ðŸ¤®",1,0.546,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,Intel 18A is coming on this year and that is 2nm. They have caught up,4,0.62,POSITIVE,0.941
,nan,How much you investing in them exactly?,5,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.929
,nan,Not a lot but I see potential in INTC making a big comeback. They didn't really fall behind AMD that much on an interior process node. Intel dropped to what 60â„… share in cpus? I think they definitely have potential to win back share from AMD.,6,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.622
,nan,TSMCâ€™s corporate culture is unique and hard to imitate.,1,0.508,POSITIVE,0.824
,nan,Are they? They just have best production lines. Doesn't have to mean upper management is competent. They build factories in USA in political move to guarantee more USA protection to Taiwan. And they happen to be the best manufacturer so far.,1,0.521,POSITIVE,0.995
,nan,You just listed a few reasons why they're managed well,2,0.533,POSITIVE,0.946
,nan,Because they happen to be placed in one of the hottest political area? Because product quality doesn't have to be brilliant because of the upper management,3,0.529,POSITIVE,0.638
,nan,Thatâ€™s exactly what competent upper management does,2,0.515,POSITIVE,0.998
,nan,Competent upper management are responsible for tsmc being based in Taiwan? xD,3,0.526,POSITIVE,0.965

,nan,"Intel has better a marketing department, but TSMC is light years ahead of Intel in technology and corporate structure. I remember a TV commercial from Intel 25 years ago, selling innovation sentiment. In 2010, they had some 'aha' moments. Now It is gone.",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.923
,nan,Why would TSMC a marketing department?,1,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.591
,nan,Didnt Intel just layoff 10k from their marketing dept....,1,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.998

,nan,are we talking about the same CEO? Gelsinger is/was an engineer,2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.788
,nan,"Nope sold out a long time ago, I donâ€™t think his leadership is that excellent but he does understand the technology and was brought in to drive results , bringing company back to roots with engineers in charge.",4,0.566,POSITIVE,0.998
,nan,Does he? How is he so far being on 10 nm after working on it for nearly 10 years? How many more decades does he need? And where will AMD and NVDIA be when finally break sub 10 nm?Also why is he think about AI just now instead of 10-20 years ago like Nvidia was?I like the idea of engineers being in charge but not all engineers are good ones and not all good engineers make good leaders.,5,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,Gelsinger has been CEO since 2021. Try and keep up.,6,0.534,POSITIVE,0.977
,nan,When they break 10nm? They're on a node comparable to TSMC's 4nm.,6,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.997
,nan,I mean is anyone really shocked by this. TSMC is managed incredibly well and continues to innovate and Intel has been the guy throwing up at the bar saying they are the greatest talking about their highschool football career. Unless they changed instrumentally at their core they will never be what they once were.Intel is gonna have issues for the next year or two at a minimum.,0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.618

,nan,Also how dating works,0,0.58,POSITIVE,0.997
,nan,It's different because TSM actually has to use the money for operations so that they don't get rolled over by China. Intel can just give half of those grants back to executives.Don't quote me though I didn't read a single thing about this except for this post.,0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Why does Intel have to be a creep about it though?,0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.896

,nan,I will never buy Intel again unless it goes to like 36 dollars a share and then I might be suckered in like a fucking MORON instead of just being smart and buying even more NVDA,0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.999
