,"I'm sure many of you have read about the potential of MRVL's AI data centers. Regarding their AI data centers, the company had initial guidance on their last ER of ~$400M revenue in Q4 2023. An update on their estimate is now ~$750M, a 50% increase! If this is not enough to persuade you, they just extended their partnership with TSMC this morning at 9 a.m. EST. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marvell-announces-industrys-first-2nm-platform-for-accelerated-infrastructure-silicon-302082510.html YoY, they are estimating a decrease of ~30% in networking (we regards know most of the networking companies ER's guidance have been poor), ~36% decrease in telecom, ~20% decrease in automobile. In order to combat this, the company has shored up these three areas by decreasing production and getting rid of inventory.
