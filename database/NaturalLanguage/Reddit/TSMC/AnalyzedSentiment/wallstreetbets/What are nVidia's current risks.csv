,"I recently opened a position in Nvidia. Everything looks like it's on the up and up for this company.

That's 3 major sections of performance computing nVidia appears to have a very strong grasp on. Coupled with strong financials to back up it's share price. I'm struggling to find the risk in this stock price.

Their biggest customers stop upgrading GPU clusters every year or in the same quantity. These are the cloud data center providers Amazon AWS, Google GCP, Microsoft Azure. New techniques for efficiently training large models and inferencing eliminates the need for bigger and better GPUs. You could see a transition from massive do everything foundation models to smaller expert models. Etc.Their biggest customers are also the ones looking to build their own AI accelerators to replace some of their Nvidia spend so you could see revenue growth decline or go negative and or profit margin decline. Amazon has their Tranium and Inferentia chips. Google has their TPU. Microsoft has their Maia chips. Tesla has Dojo D1. Meta has MTIA. Apple has their own on device chips. And then you've got AMD with a competitive data center lineup the next few years that could eat into profitability. Nvidia is making too much money and their profit margins have ballooned. This invites competition and their biggest customers also want to be their competitors. Big tech is dumping massive sums of money into replacing Nvidia dependence and they are all using the same people to make their chips (TSMC, Broadcom, etc).",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.923

And Microsoft has been working hard on an interoperability layer that removes the need to program for specific hardware. So with my puny account, I'm going to start slanting it towards AMD (I already have enough Microsoft).AMD 'only' has a market cap of $260 billion vs Nvidia's $2.996 trillion. As AI tech evolves to become less hardware dependent, companies like AMD will readily step in to fill the supply void. I suspect that nvidia's moat isn't as big as many people assume. In fact, being a first mover isn't always beneficial as competitors can watch, and potentially capitalise on costly mistakes made by the incumbent.",1,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0
