,nan,The REAL inflation reduction act is robots. Brother when the market tanks profits become paramount. You want to reduce the workforce then you build robots and AI. AI and robots are the new digital gold. Watch,1,0.556,POSITIVE,0.998
,nan,Robot stocks you would recommend?,2,0.538,POSITIVE,0.998
,nan,I wish. The number 1 robot stock right now is Nvidia. And I am dead serious. Their Jetson Nano product line will be absolutely crucial to robotics. Look for that to be a growing business segment. Then when you want to train the AI for the robots to move and think that's all Nvidia. So for robot stocks Nvidia is well positioned.ARM is well positioned because for all those Jetson Nano's they are built with ARM chips and ARM chips is also crucial to robotics. Can't have your robot getting hot.Direct sales robot stocks you probably won't see fruits of labor that are commercialized until end 2024 - end 2025.If I could get into OpenAI right now I would sell my wife and kids and put everything I have into that. But you can't. Figure AI is another great company. Tesla is making Optimus but it's wrapped in a horrific car company right now so...Options are limited but there is Nvidia. And ARM.,3,0.566,POSITIVE,0.98
,nan,"Don't forget AMZN too.One of Americas largest employers, and they are very much deep into robots - after all, they have the incentive.And the rest of their business is dope too. EPS has sucked for a while from the constant investment but they are prime to reap those rewards now.",4,0.534,POSITIVE,1.0
,nan,Great company. A lot of overhead. Still number 1 in cloud. Doesn't have a direct AI play. They will use a lot of robots. They have their own shipping network that is killing UPS and fedex right now.Do they have a dividend? I don't know just wouldn't put it in the growth category. Microsoft is a great stock too but I was more on the growth aspect of an investment.,5,0.573,POSITIVE,0.982

,nan,"It's completely possible. The only thing holding these stocks back is the incessant CNBC off the cuff opinions about how Intel is going to do something and other players that have shown shit other than they are in the space.Literally, NVDA dropped 4% yesterday at some point because Intel released announced a chip that competes with 2 year old tech (HB100).",1,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Do you think TSM can hit 150 before next Thursday? Or is everything going to be red for a while.,0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.997
,nan,I don't have a clue what will happen. I will say that it has a fantastic earnings and is getting $6 Billion from the US government to get those US factories built on the homeland. It should go up. If you're trading there is not a reason to go down. If your calls/puts I wish you well.,1,0.531,POSITIVE,0.957
