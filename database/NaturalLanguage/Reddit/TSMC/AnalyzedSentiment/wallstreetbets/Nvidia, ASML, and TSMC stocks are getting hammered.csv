,nan,"Seems to be tug of war between Biden and Trump on who's more harsher on Chyna""Shares of semiconductor stocks have come under massive pressure as the U.S. is considering more stringent trade curbs in its crackdown on China's access to advanced chips.The Biden administration is said to be weighing stricter trade restrictions if companies such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML (AS:ASML) continue to provide China access to advanced semiconductor technology.Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and TSM both dropped 7% during US market hours, while other stocks like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) also retreated. According to a report from Bloomberg, the Biden administration is facing pushback to its chip crackdown on China. The U.S. government is said to have told allies it is considering using the harshest trade restrictions available if they continue giving China access to advanced semiconductor technology.""",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Micron barely gets revenue from China. One doesn‚Äôt belong in that list‚Ä¶,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yeah it dropped in sympathy sadly. Worry is if whole supply chain gets disrupted due to TSM, it might affect Micron customers (read NVDA) and indirectly affect Micron. Shouldn't have dropped as much as others but market rarely moves logically.I personally almost doubled my MU position today so fingers crossed TSM tomorrow won't cause another dump.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Micron trades based on P/B ratio since p/e is funky. It trades at 3x vs 3.5x when it was trading at 157 which makes it incredibly attractive. Assets are growing significantly so that will lead to price appreciation. Taiwan sanctions will not affect production for US clients.
