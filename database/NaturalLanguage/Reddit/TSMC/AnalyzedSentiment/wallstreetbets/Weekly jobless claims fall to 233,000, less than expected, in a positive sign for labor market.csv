,"Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months üìà. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%! This echoes Goldman Sachs' recent increase in the U.S. recession probability, from 15% to 25%‚¨ÜÔ∏è. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/weekly-jobless-claims-fall-to-233000-less-than-expected-in-a-positive-sign-for-labor-market.html",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan
