,"Buffet's latest position. Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. But why now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. What about Taiwan-China crisis? One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet trims 20% BYD for TSMC - What does it mean for the semiconductor industry? 20% of Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Final Thoughts My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'm not a financial analyst, and this is not a recommendation.

,"Buffet's latest position. Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. But why now? Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet. What about Taiwan-China crisis? One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company. Buffet trims 20% BYD for TSMC - What does it mean for the semiconductor industry? 20% of Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market. Final Thoughts My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point. I'm not a financial analyst, and this is not a recommendation. Adding my portfolio performance just to give you a sense of my investment style","I was mainly referring to the fact that even though China might ban Taiwanese companies or try to hurt Taiwanese economy, TSMC shouldn't be majorly affected.",1,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.999
