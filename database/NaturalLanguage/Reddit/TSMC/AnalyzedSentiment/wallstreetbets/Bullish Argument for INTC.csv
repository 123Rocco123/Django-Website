,"Before I even start, take all this with a tiny grain of salt, I currently have ~600$ in my Robinhood, and ~500$ of it is in a long call for Intel expiring in 2024. Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter. Fundamentals As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was ~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of ~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of ~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology. Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc. (source: https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) Current Policies Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan. I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html) While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain.

Recent History In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months). Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back. Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers. Final Thoughts The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock. Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance. While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such. Thank you!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Thank you!","On the subject of x86 in the server space, performance per watt is actually important and CPU speed might not be as critical as you would think. In my experience most of the web app servers for web applications. I have run are massively RAM bottlenecked and use a negligible amount of total Compute capacity for those instances. AWS was advertising too us to switch over to their custom arm platform which would apparently reduce price. In large enterprise environments what your balancing is responsiveness of systems / price of system. ARM chips being more efficient unit of compute per watt mean they are cheaper to run. This makes ARM deeply appealing as a platform to run a variety of jobs on.",0,0.521,POSITIVE,0.995

For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance. While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such.

I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational.

Recent History In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months). Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world.

I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers.

He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back. Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers. Final Thoughts The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock. Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance. While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such. Thank you!",😂,1,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.761
,"Before I even start, take all this with a tiny grain of salt, I currently have ~600$ in my Robinhood, and ~500$ of it is in a long call for Intel expiring in 2024. Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter. Fundamentals As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was ~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of ~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of ~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology. Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc. (source: https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) Current Policies Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan. I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology.

Recent History In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted.

Recent History In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months). Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back. Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers. Final Thoughts The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock. Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance. While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries.

Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc. (source: https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) Current Policies Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan. I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html) While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain.

Recent History In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months). Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back. Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers. Final Thoughts The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock. Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance. While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such.

And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such.

,"Before I even start, take all this with a tiny grain of salt, I currently have ~600$ in my Robinhood, and ~500$ of it is in a long call for Intel expiring in 2024. Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter. Fundamentals As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was ~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of ~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of ~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology. Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc. (source: https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) Current Policies Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan. I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html) While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain. (source: https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel_germany_tsmc/#:~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber.) Recent History In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months). Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back. Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers. Final Thoughts The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock. Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance. While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run. Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such.
