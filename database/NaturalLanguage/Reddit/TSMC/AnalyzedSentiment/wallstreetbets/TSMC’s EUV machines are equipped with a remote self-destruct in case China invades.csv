,nan,"Well one of the biggest things preventing war between China and the U.S. was how economically dependent they are on each other. Now we’re seeing the beginnings of both nations decoupling, so the potential for war is just higher unfortunately.",1,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.971
,nan,Worst mistake we made was moving most manufacturing over their now we don't have the experience they do and it will take decades to learn.,2,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.995
,nan,"We traded manufacturing capacity for lower prices and fatter billionaires. Now the quality and size of every product are being reduced every year to make more corporate profits, and life gets worse and worse for the average American.We are on an awful trajectory and we need to reorganize our labor pronto.",3,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"In case you didnt get it, thats what immigration is for. Cheap labor. It pushes labor costs down. Unforunately also for the average american. Welcome in the United States of South America.PS: Europe has the same immigration ""problem"". We should all thank our central planning elite the WEF for handling the USA and Europe so well with immigration, wokeness and all the other bullshit.",4,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,We ate the seed corn. It tasted pretty good 30 years ago.,4,0.524,POSITIVE,0.988
,nan,When a big bully country beside you that send/have ton of spy in your country and they openly said they will make you theirs even if it's mean war.Is a normal things to do,1,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.737
,nan,"And the worst part, even Taiwanese would have a hard time picking up Chinese spies. They speak the same language, look the same, have family in Taiwan....I think the ultimate deterrent is the US dropping a MOAB on the whole facility if China get in. Otherwise, whatever self destruct mechanism TSM implemented, there's a good chance China knows what it is and how to disable it. And don't discount human nature for greed, it only takes one of the guys who implemented it to be bought.",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"If self destruct doesnt work, there are always rockets. I guess thats what all the carriers are there for. 2nd insurance. Crazy how chip production is the major tug of war currently.",3,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.971
,nan,"Nah no shot.I bet you the only people at TSM that know how to use the remote self destruct mechanism are very carefully vetted and trusted, their communications to anyone are probably closely monitored as well.",3,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.971
,nan,That's fucken bad azz.,0,0.497,NEGATIVE,0.995
,nan,"Bad for ChinaGood for IntelGood for Taiwanese, don't have to work anymore after invasion",1,0.502,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,It's hardly work to have your organs harvested.,2,0.504,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,How long would it take the US to mobilise and reach Taiwan? Chinese forces might make it to Taiwan but they ain't making it back to china,3,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,"Well, you do have to remember the US does keep a strike force constantly in that area, so at best a few hours to a day or at worse a week depending if they're in the middle of rotation, which would be China's best time to strike.",4,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.99
,nan,"Do you not think the US is sophisticated enough to predict with very good accuracy when an attack would startThere is force build up being observed via satellite, communication intercepts etc it would be impossible for them to disguise it",5,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.991
,nan,I would like to belive the US spy network is very healthy in that area especially how much of early warning they had when Russia launched their invasion of Ukraine. So they'll probably be well informed if China finally makes a move. More than like the US submarine fleet will end up making up the first task force to engage the Chinese before any air carrier strike force arrives to Taiwan.,6,0.524,POSITIVE,0.753
,nan,"It ain't that easy to get to Taiwan for the Chinese soldiers as well. Coast is rocky and tgere are few places they can and. All of which are guarded. There are already us forces in tge region on top of Japanese, Korean, Australian etc. The reason Taiwan wasn't conquered after tge revolution is exactly that. If you dobt have complete supremacy and you are not prepared to lose a loooooooot of soldiers attacking, you are not attacking. And China doesn't have either.",4,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,Why do people keep saying this? Nothing about Taiwan’s west coast is rocky. It’s full of flatlands and beaches and ports.,5,0.501,NEGATIVE,0.888
,nan,Exactly because the west is the heavily populated area and heavily defended you won't land there unless you want your ships and troops to be a target practice while landing in cities in chaos. There are only few strategic points where China can land and regroup. And they are also defended.,6,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.963

,nan,Chips in general. Cars. Phones. Home utilities. Etc etc etc. 90% of all,3,0.503,POSITIVE,0.994
,nan,Chips for cars are generally made in older fabs that are in Europe for european cars.,4,0.511,POSITIVE,0.926
,nan,Taiwan still produces majority and also a large portion of the American made cars. The europe fab is still pretty small.,5,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.877

,nan,Calls cause cool?,1,0.503,NEGATIVE,0.992
,nan,Puts because some ‘guard will accidentally hit the self destruct button.,2,0.499,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,.........a reguard,3,0.5,POSITIVE,0.993
,nan,A mod on another thread seemed to get real pissy about using the term regarded. They’re going to try to cancel this term too…So I stand on ‘guard for thee 🫡,4,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"That’s nice and all but I think China cares more about putting a gap in the first island chain. Short term, the economic fallout could be crippling, but long term China’s national security would have improved, providing that they actually win.",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.99
,nan,This man geopolitics.,1,0.502,POSITIVE,0.999
,nan,Chip production is national security,1,0.543,POSITIVE,0.992
,nan,Lmao assuming the US wants to attack China which is ridiculous.  ,1,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"US wants China to be subordinated. US considers a China-Taiwan war the ideal, desirable scenario, at any price to the Taiwanese. If this does not pan out, US will push for a favorable confrontation elsewhere, because if left alone, China will keep doing too well for US comfort.",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,"It is ridiculous and I’m not sure why you were downvoted… but I also said nothing of the sort.However, China is thinking long-term (US elected Trump… Who knows what sort of idiot they could elect in 50 years?), and they aren’t thinking about an invasion, but rather a naval blockade against them. Even the threat of a naval blockade is useful for the West.",2,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Then building more ships makes sense.  Not attacking a rando island. ,3,0.511,POSITIVE,0.976
,nan,"An island is 1000x more effective at force projection than ships, even if it is a fleet of carriers that eclipses all of the US’s combined multiple times.",4,0.507,POSITIVE,0.922
,nan,This means there will still be a cataclysmic chip shortage if an invasion occurs,0,0.513,POSITIVE,0.921
,nan,"Taiwan has a huge arsenal of anti rocket/missile defenses on the island. They've been preparing for Chinese missile barrage for decades. If you think it will be easy for China to just remotely blow up anything in Taiwan, you've been watching too much CCP propaganda.The whole nation is dedicated to its defense. When I was in school there, we didn't do tornado drills. We did missile attack drills. The basement of the school was a bunker with a month of food stored in it.I will never forget the pictures in the newspaper one day of the major political parties going on pleasure cruises out into the ocean to watch the Chinese rockets splash down in the water. You might recall it from years ago when Clinton sent a carrier to Taiwan so China would chill out and stop lobbing rockets at Taiwan. Well, none of them got anywhere near hitting anything. China claimed it was intentional, but no one I talked to in Taiwan believed them.To me, this article is just another hint for China to not even bother trying it...it won't work out for anyone. If they invade, everyone looses.",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,China was weak as fuck during the Clinton era. I think we can win this fight no doubt but it won't be a cake walk. Also the Chinese military has terrible moral and is incompetent since they haven't fought a war in decades. Last skirmish they had was a club and crowbar fight with India in 2020 on the Tibetan border 😂.,1,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"We saw how overrated the russian army was, same for the chinese. Only thing going for them is the mass of soldiers and gear, thereby overwhelming their opponents at some point",2,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,Drones and robots don’t need morale,3,0.498,NEGATIVE,0.997
,nan,"Ukraine is defending well via small drone units, so that argument falls short because Taiwan would inflict heavy damage on MBTs and other key elements too",4,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.984
,nan,"I mean didn't the USA army struggle in most ""wars"" as well? Against ""weaker"" opponents.Like Vietnam, Iraq, and AfghanistanMight be wrong though, I'm no expert.",2,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.953
,nan,"Some would argue those are very different conflicts with guerilla fighting.When the US fought the government run armies in Iraq and Afghanistan they blew through them in months. It was the post war occupation where they lost.US is best in the world in traditional conflicts by far, it’s the other type of fighting they suck at lol",3,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.966
,nan,We fought a government in Afghanistan? When?,4,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.888
,nan,"Uhhhh the Taliban, the group who currently runs the government in Afghanistan",5,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.99
,nan,GPT-REEEE,6,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,all that and taiwan's real deterrence from China is actually just us/the west's backing.,1,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.941
,nan,ah yes 24+ years ago is so relevant to today.,1,0.545,POSITIVE,0.996
,nan,China wont be remotely destroying the fabs. We will. And they want T for the geostrategic location more than TSMC.And by 2027 they will be near-peer and we lose T along with the Western Pac.,1,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.54
,nan,Taijuan is a sitting duck literally after the few missiles that pass through it will be ggez,1,0.499,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,Hardwired to self destruct! Sorry had to quote a metallica song. Nice moves there Tsmc.,0,0.5,POSITIVE,0.998
,nan,China just posted a video on how it could invade without destroying the real reason it wants to invade. Lol sweet summer child.,0,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.816
,nan,I hope the detonators are not IoT connected....,0,0.501,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,Definitely calls,0,0.51,POSITIVE,0.997
,nan,What if they fake an invasion?,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.99
,nan,Presumably they would self destruct as they reached them. It would have to be a pretty good invasion.,1,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.987
,nan,"No need, China is already on 5nm process node, catching up to 2nm pretty soon",0,0.516,POSITIVE,0.887
,nan,Taiwan number one,0,0.517,POSITIVE,0.997
,nan,"Let up the vacuum system of EUV machines and get in and use hammer blow to each of the big mirrors.The big EUV mirrors are the main part of the machine, most expensive to manufacture. Tin droplet system and CO2 laser are simple technology.Basically entire cost of Taiwan invasion would yield domestic Chinese EUV system development so it makes me wonder why do they even bother considering the military action, especially when considering the cost/benefit analysis.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.542
,nan,"lol I just commented this idea 2 days ago, didn't know it was legit but makes total sense. China just needs to realize they are just like the West, we all love business/trade, we just value individualism whereas they are more collectivist, but we all just want everyone to work together and flourish.",0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.996
,nan,pretty sure when it comes to being the dominant country in the world its a zero sum game.,1,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.982
,nan,"not everyone can flourish, by definition. it's a term / condition that implies differential. and that's okay.",1,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.905
,nan,The only thing that country is good at is issuing final warnings.,0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.998

,nan,Cool story. But highly unlikely. ,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.653
,nan,I think I’ve seen this movie before. Rebel moon they strap bombs to the silos of grain to have strength over their invaders that need the grain.,0,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.984
,nan,"There's a (probably apocryphal) story about a nuclear weapons inspector palming a centrifuge, saying how that was enough to ensure it could never be used again.I imagine there are numerous spots in the plant could be rendered inoperable with similar low-efforts. Literally nano-meter thick printing/lithography, that already results in wafers with some number of defective chips per batch, under IDEAL conditions, could easily be permanently destroyed.",0,0.51,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,This still is bad news for Tsmc lol if China comes knocking ,0,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"China doesn't need a military invasion. They could implement a sort of ""customs quarantine"" where they slow/stop commerce through bureaucracy, inspections, rerouting ships to mainland ports.In the words of the The Economic Times article “What China could do take control of Taiwan sans full-scale invasion”:This 2022 RAND report (pp. 8–12), excerpted below, describes how exactly China might impose a customs quarantine on Taiwan.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.993
,nan,"Why would you announce this? Wouldn't this, however unlikely, increase the odds that someone like China hacks this ""feature""? Say, China tries for Taiwan and ASML turns on the kill switch...
