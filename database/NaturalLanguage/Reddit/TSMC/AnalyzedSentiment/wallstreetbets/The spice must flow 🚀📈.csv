,nan,It‚Äôs a space fantasy set far beyond all post apocalyptic scenarios.Remember one of the underpinning themes of this story is to reject technology. ‚ÄúThou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man‚Äôs mind‚ÄùThe whole AI thing?

,nan,"I like ASML and hold a fair amount of it, I see it kind of like ‚ÄúTSMC minus the China risk‚Äù. But that‚Äôs also totally priced in so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.99
,nan,"The china risk being if china invades the US would ""would be forced"" to destroy TSMC's foundries.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/taiwan-will-defend-tsmc-from-us-bombing-in-the-event-of-a-china-war",2,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"Let's be real tho, if something happened to TSMC it would also tank ASML. If you're investing in one, it's a vote of confidence for the other.TSMC is the cheaper one atm",2,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,"How so? You know ASML makes the machines that makes the chips. If the geopolitical risk actually escalates then the west is going to take out the money printer to manufacture the chips, a critical ressource themselves.Asml has guaranteed growth for like a decade imo",3,0.523,POSITIVE,0.967
,nan,"TSMC is the biggest buyer of ASML's EUV scanners. So it stands to reason if ASML's biggest buyer were caught in a war (as others in this thread have suggested), it would negatively affect their share price.",4,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.646
,nan,"I agree in the very unlikely case of an invasion ASML will be hurt too, but not nearly as much as TSMC. And ASML has a monopoly on the machines used by every fab...",5,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.551
,nan,I think it will hurt Asml for a few years but will recover.,6,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"For sure. TSMC has way more to lose in that scenario, but it would affect all chip adjacent stocks.I think the near-term risk of war is overblown anyway. October was a great entry point in ASML and I'm kicking myself for not buying then, so I'll be sticking to TSMC for now as geopolitical risk has artificially been suppressing prices.",6,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,Yeah totally. I think I'm going to rotate into TSMC over the next week or two.,3,0.584,POSITIVE,0.658
,nan,Same. I started building a position this past week and will probably continue to buy more.,4,0.571,POSITIVE,0.973
