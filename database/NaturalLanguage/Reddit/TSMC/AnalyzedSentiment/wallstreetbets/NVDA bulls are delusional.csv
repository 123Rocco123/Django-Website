Also LLMs (using a transformer architecture) seem to be the only AI model that actually develops emergent properties with a scale in compute (ie. # of parameters). It's more likely that better optimizations (larger and better pruned datasets, parameter tuning, different encoder/decoder structures and width, FP8 tensor code) to decrease the compute required for LLMs will be the trend, not that transformers will become obsolete. It's certainly possible but I will say that most research pursuing AGI has been focused on transformers and LLMs more specifically. If we were to see a trend pointing to transformer obsolescence for this purpose we would be likely to see promising papers coming out right about now pointing toward a better model for achieving AGI, however as far as I'm aware no (or few credible) publications exist regarding more promising models (for comparison, the real promise for transformers was shown about 5 years ago, hence why I'd anticipate something more promising being published around now if it indeed does exist)",3,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
