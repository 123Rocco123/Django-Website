But there will be covert US military support like subs sinking Chinese ships. We would ship Taiwan modern, current generation weapons and systems. Ukraine got plastic tinker toys in comparison to the support Taiwan would get.Also OP you are like 5+ years behind in information and also misinformed. AI has already been useful and profitable.

Ever.They make enough money WITHOUT having to spend over 25B a year building new fabs to master the most difficult manufacturing process on earth.Also if Taiwan was invaded tomorrow Intel would lose their entire new laptop chip production since TSMC manufactures all of the compute tiles on the Lunar Lake SoC.,0,nan,nan,nan

The problem is the only thing they‚Äôre beating the US in is soldiers. China is too big to actually invade and Taiwan is too small to send excessive numbers of ground troops though. Yes they can overwhelm Taiwan but the US has so many troops positioned in striking distance they would be sitting ducks. Japan also has/ will have 100s of f35s. You do realize the US has 120k+ troops in Japan, we have air bases in Okinawa. Our planes are 20 minutes away in .86 Mach. And have enough fuel. Same with Philippines. Since Russia didn‚Äôt overwhelm and succeed in Ukraine the door way closed for china to do this anytime soon. Also what would happen is china would be in a war with the US India Japan Philippines Australia South Korea. They will be so busy fighting everyone Russia will literally put of a fence where ever they want and there is nothing china can do about it. It‚Äôs not happening anytime soon. Smoke and mirrors. I think you guys forget the US is the only country with more than 2 aircraft carriers.. and they have 11 carriers groups.. 3 more being made as as we speak. China can have its way with Taiwan, but they are not ready or prepared for taking on the war after. Their balls won‚Äôt drop until at least 2030.",0,nan,nan,nan

But then it slowly and slowly became a second tier company to work for. Why? Because it does not pay its engineers a competitive salary.Whenever you see a tech company not pay its engineers competitive salaries, it's almost guaranteed that the company will fall behind in a few years. The management may like saving whatever dollars they can so their numbers would look great, but innovation comes from engineers, and there are just way too many jobs out there that engineers can go take if they feel like they aren't fairly compensated.Intel has definitely become a second tier place to work for. It's been like that for at least 5 years now. It's gotten much worse, and I doubt they can recover their reputation as now they are in no position to offer competitive salary as they make no money. A huge blunder and honestly their c suites should all be fired.Anyway, nvidia has a great leadership, pays very well, attracts all the top talents. So long as this doesn't change, nvda will be doing very well.There are few other companies I also wanna mention but maybe for some other times. Just look at levels.fyi and check out engineer compensation. Companies will do as well as how they pay their engineers.",0,nan,nan,nan
