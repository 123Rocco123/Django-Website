,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the world's largest contract chip maker, reported better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter but missed on sales. The company also provided below-average guidance for the current quarter as demand for chips weakens. Despite this, TSM's stock rose in early trading. For the December quarter, TSMC earned $1.82 per U.S. share on sales of $19.93 billion. Analysts had predicted earnings of $1.80 per share and sales of $20.6 billion. Compared to the same period last year, TSMC's earnings increased by 57% and sales grew by 30%. TSMC forecasted sales for the current quarter to be between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion. The midpoint of $17.1 billion falls below Wall Street's target of $17.65 billion. This implies a year-over-year sales growth of just 1% for the first quarter. What they're saying: ""Our fourth-quarter business was affected by weakened end-market demand and customers' inventory adjustments, despite the ongoing ramp-up of our industry-leading 5-nanometer technologies,"" said Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang in a statement. He also mentioned that due to weak macroeconomic conditions, the company expects to see further impact on its business in the first quarter of 2023. TSMC noted that there has been a decrease in demand for data center chips, while demand for chips for smartphones and consumer electronics remains weak. The company projects low single-digit percentage growth for 2023 and implies that the second quarter may mark the lowest point for revenue for the year. Analysts have mixed reactions to the report, with some reiterating their buy ratings on TSM stock and others maintaining a neutral rating. Source: IBD About the company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is a leading global semiconductor foundry that designs and manufactures a wide range of integrated circuits for customers in a variety of industries.
