Not too much to assume earnings will follow suit.So then it’s all about forward guidance. Their 2nd half is stronger than first mainly due to phone upgrade cycles. TSMC current guidance is 20-25% revenue growth. But they are now at 28% already.Do they have the nerve to sandbag and maintain 20-25%. I don’t think so and stars are aligned for that magical trifecta of rev beat + earnings beat + raised guidance.,0,nan,nan,nan
