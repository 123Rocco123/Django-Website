,"This is a US based Semiconductor company that is leading the field in GPU/CPU chips and other computer hardware. They’re the first American company to produce a chip with seven nanometers nodes. They have 68 billion in total assets and even tho they did miss revenue projections last quarter they also had an increase in assets compared with liabilities. There P/E ratio is pretty high but they’re investing in equipment to increase production and I like their management team. Their management team is ran by engineers from the computer science industry. Not a bunch of chad finance bros like ourselves. Their main competitor is Intel whose proved they cannot successful produce chips with less then 10 nanometer nodes. AMD on the other hand is poised to take over the PC market with their fast and energy efficient CPUs. I think investors are willing to pay the premium for a company they know that has a large section of the market cornered. They have major contracts with companies to produce chips. Their new chip is the best in the world for gaming. I already hold a litany of semiconductor companies in my portfolio like ASML, INTL, MRVL and ON. Intel just outsourced its new 7nm tech to TSMC which could save the company, but it will take a while to catch up with AMD and their new chips. They’ve also increased revenue year after year in a stagnant market. It has gained market share for nine straight quarters. Their new processors use less power then Intels, yet the crux is they are more expensive then other hardware on the market. AMD is working on a 5 nanometer chip. The smaller the node length the better. The military and supercomputer industry will be very interested in these chips. What do you think? Looking for some gigachad answers? I’ve done plenty of DD on these companies but want options on the companies themselves but more importantly the growth of the sector.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

You don’t know the size of the transistors but, the Intel chips create a lot more heat which means longer circuits. I would reckon that AMD probably has smaller transistors then Intel at this point. But, I honestly don’t know if that hypothesis is correct it could create more heat from different factors. Intel makes a good product. Their raptor lake chips are probably a littler better at overall computing comparable to the Ryzen series. But, the Ryzen series is much better for gaming and uses less energy. For years Intel was ran by account/finance bros. Intel really needed someone with a PhD or an electrical engineering degree to run the company. Intel has been loosing market share for years now. Yet they’re still a very profitable company. To be honest I own shares in AMD and Intel. I like both companies and think there’s enough room in their industry for them both to exist profitably. I’ll hold AMD for a few more weeks possibly feeling some overall bullish sentiment in the market. Intel on the other hand is looking slightly undervalued. I’ll hold for longer. They’d finally admitted defeat and ask TSMC to make their chips. This was a desperate move by Intel but the only one that makes sense anymore. Luckily I bough ASML holding stock when it was 385$ a share. I just took profits today.",1,0.553,NEGATIVE,0.949

These chips cost magnitudes more than the PC chips.Don’t confuse benchmarks, and what the niche gaming market is buying, as who is performing better. I know AMD has a better chip available, I know there’s a better model of the nVidia card I got, but I bought what I thought was the best deal at the time, Intel 12th Gen, for what I need to use my computer for.I think investing in AMD is a fine investment, but realize your are hopping in years after the hype train and forward thinking has already been priced in, and still correcting in my opinion.I was trading this, with all the knowledge you mentioned, for $39 a couple years ago.

I’m not saying that Intel isn’t a profitable company. I’m aware they’re one of the biggest producers of wafers in the world, but AMD seems to be slightly more innovative. If they can make a better chip it’s only a matter of time before consumers catch on. Their hurdle is the price. If they can make a cheaper CPU they’ll win.Also, yes I’m aware everything is probably priced in. I’ve already taken 3/4 profits on ASML and a few other tech companies. But, everything was priced in 5 years ago when the SP was at 2,600. I don’t wanna miss out on growth of an industry.

We probably plateau for a while like Intel with 10nm before we hit the proverbial ""end"" (2nm is the smallest I think?).AMD has a two-prong war. It fights Intel on the CPU end (don't write off Apple either). It fights Nvidia on the GPU end. In both instances, AMD is dramatically smaller and has to be very efficient with its cash. Intel and Nvidia got R&D + PR + advertising money to burn. Intel and Nvidia have moats. AMD, even if it produces quality products, needs to break through its competitors' market share dominance. This gives us a glass half-empty vs half-full perspective. It's bullish to think AMD can gobble up a lot of market share. It's depressing to see them beaten down as an underdog. They would need a revolutionary product to capture like +15-20% more market share and their competitors to continue to shit the bed. I don't see AMD having 50% of either the CPU or GPU market.I like semiconductors. I like the industry long-term as buy-and-hold. I think there's some serious geopolitical headwinds and literal politics getting in the way of business. I think there are some really attractive valuations out there. I'm afraid of forcing myself to buy in now. I've sat through most of this year with cash. A few more months won't hurt me.",0,0.563,NEGATIVE,1.0

But, they have to build these chips with 3D models and software so there’s a little tech mixed in. On the basis of their P/E ratio which is around 44. Compared to other companies in the industry it’s at an appropriate level. I’m not a lifetime investor but my hypothesis is the idea these companies have a lot of room for growth. They are the future of industry, they work with cutting edge machines and quantum mechanics. A company like ASML holding is promoting scientific discoveries that are new to mankind. The industry is moving fast and it’s hard to keep up as an investor. Yet, chip demand is supposed to increase exponentially over the next ten years. Intel and other fab companies are also playing around with quantum computing. It will be very interesting to see what happens. I’m probably going to take profits on AMD soon but will hold Intel a little longer because I’m my opinion it’s undervalued. They are still a very profitable and cutting edge company.",3,0.566,POSITIVE,0.711
