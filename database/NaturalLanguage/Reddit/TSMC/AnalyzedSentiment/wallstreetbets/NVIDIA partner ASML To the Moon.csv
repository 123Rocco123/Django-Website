The fact is, there is an extremely limited customer base for ASML. There are only about 10 serious chip makers on the planet. There has been a spike in fab building in the West to de-couple from China, but it won't last.

So what is the case you are making? If you are in the fabs you know they have limited demand for ASML tools (and AMAT proportionately sells the same number of tools as ASML (AMAT has many type of tools for ASML's essentially one tool), yet trades at less than 1/2 the multiple. You also know that the semi industry is mature, regardless of the hype around NVDA, which does not even have a fab but contracts TSMC and now INTC to build its chips, meanwhile INTC has launched its own GPU line, why not? The industry has a decade long growth rate less than 6%. There are no new INTCs or TSMCs popping up anywhere. Once a fab is built (the building craze now is fueled by the need to de-couple from China) and the tool supplied, it won't be added to. Service, yes. New machines, no. If China annexes Taiwan, the China market will be cut off from western equipment manufacturers.

And yes, they pick up service business when they sell a new machine. And they always have. It is not a new profit stream. They are an old and established player and are growing at market rates. There is no market share for them to pick up since they are practically 100%. The semi equipment market is growing at 6% and might grow at 10% for a few years due to the flurry of new fabs to de-couple from China. I doubt NVDA and GPUs will have much of an impact on global chip demand. It is really substitution from CPUs to GPUs which is why Intel's numbers have been off the last year and also why they have gone over to GPUs, along with AMD. And NVDA is not a customer for ASML since NVDA has no fabs. All their demand shows up in TSMC and soon INTC, which have massive capacity that dwarfs NVDA GPU demand.",1,0.581,NEGATIVE,0.984

The company that is the fab business, which INTC always controlled from its inception in the 1960s, will work to become the best fab company in the world.
