,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor; I barely know how to read. Russia updated the existing playbook re: how to invade a neighboring country without getting the US involved. At this point, it doesn't seem to be ""whether"" China will invade Taiwan, it's more like ""when"". And apparently Taiwan and semiconductors have some sort of relationship. So I asked ChatGPT, ""Who has technology, know-how, resources, etc. to actually try to cover a potential loss of semiconductors or increase in prices?"" Semiconductor manufacturing is a highly specialized and capital-intensive industry, and it cannot be quickly or easily ramped up in response to sudden geopolitical changes. The technology, knowledge, and infrastructure required to build advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities (also known as fabs) can take years, if not decades, to develop and billions of dollars in investment. If China were to invade Taiwan, potentially disrupting the operations of major Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), it would have a significant impact on the global semiconductor supply chain, including the U.S. market. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following entities might potentially step in to mitigate such a disruption: Intel Corporation (USA): Intel has been investing heavily in its manufacturing capabilities and announced in 2021 that it plans to become a major provider of foundry services in the U.S. and Europe. However, as of 2021, Intel's foundry capabilities are not yet on par with TSMC's in terms of the most advanced processes. Samsung Electronics (South Korea): Samsung has extensive semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and could potentially increase its production to cover some of the demand, but this would require significant investment and time. Other global semiconductor manufacturers: Other companies, such as Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, or Infineon, could potentially increase their production or expand into new areas, but they would face similar challenges as Intel and Samsung. US Government initiatives: The U.S. government has been taking steps to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This includes proposed funding and incentives for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing through legislation like the CHIPS for America Act. Global cooperation: Other countries and regions, including Europe and Japan, are also interested in expanding their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Global cooperation could help mitigate the impact of a potential disruption in Taiwan. However, it's important to note that any mitigation efforts would face significant challenges and would likely take several years to have a substantial impact. The most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as those used by TSMC to produce 5nm and 3nm chips, are incredibly complex and difficult to replicate. Additionally, expanding semiconductor manufacturing capabilities would require significant investment, a highly skilled workforce, and an extensive supplier network. As such, it's unlikely that any entity could fully cover a significant disruption in Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing in the short term. Then I looked at Intel's stock, sitting at like ~$30, less than half of what it was two years ago with basically the same balance sheet, and started wondering, am I missing something here? How can the market be so fickle with this company that actually *makes* physical/real stuff? Is Intel not a decent-looking buy/hold given their $20b investment in a New Albany manufacturing facility and other non-Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing locations (e.g. Ireland)? Would it be an easy buy ""if"" China invades Taiwan? Even if not, isn't every day China doesn't invade Taiwan an extra day Intel gets to play catch up? Is the time-horizon on this too long to be interesting? Is Apple going to step in and prevent this war?",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

They have in-house facilities and equipment (a substantial amount of it) but it's nowhere near as cutting edge as what TSMC and to a lesser degree Samsung have. A few years ago they kind of seemed to throw in the towel on competing as a fab. I'm not sure if it's an expertise issue or a design issue, because it's not like TSMC builds the equipment they use to manufacture 5nm and 3nm chips. But Intel has acknowledged their struggles in this area and seems to be trying to focus on other aspects of their business. They've even tried to purchase production time from TSMC, which indicates that their in-house fabs aren't even sufficient to produce their own designs on some level.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following entities might potentially step in to mitigate such a disruption: Intel Corporation (USA): Intel has been investing heavily in its manufacturing capabilities and announced in 2021 that it plans to become a major provider of foundry services in the U.S. and Europe. However, as of 2021, Intel's foundry capabilities are not yet on par with TSMC's in terms of the most advanced processes. Samsung Electronics (South Korea): Samsung has extensive semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and could potentially increase its production to cover some of the demand, but this would require significant investment and time. Other global semiconductor manufacturers: Other companies, such as Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, or Infineon, could potentially increase their production or expand into new areas, but they would face similar challenges as Intel and Samsung. US Government initiatives: The U.S. government has been taking steps to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This includes proposed funding and incentives for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing through legislation like the CHIPS for America Act. Global cooperation: Other countries and regions, including Europe and Japan, are also interested in expanding their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Global cooperation could help mitigate the impact of a potential disruption in Taiwan. However, it's important to note that any mitigation efforts would face significant challenges and would likely take several years to have a substantial impact. The most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as those used by TSMC to produce 5nm and 3nm chips, are incredibly complex and difficult to replicate. Additionally, expanding semiconductor manufacturing capabilities would require significant investment, a highly skilled workforce, and an extensive supplier network. As such, it's unlikely that any entity could fully cover a significant disruption in Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing in the short term. Then I looked at Intel's stock, sitting at like ~$30, less than half of what it was two years ago with basically the same balance sheet, and started wondering, am I missing something here? How can the market be so fickle with this company that actually *makes* physical/real stuff? Is Intel not a decent-looking buy/hold given their $20b investment in a New Albany manufacturing facility and other non-Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing locations (e.g. Ireland)? Would it be an easy buy ""if"" China invades Taiwan? Even if not, isn't every day China doesn't invade Taiwan an extra day Intel gets to play catch up?

Samsung Electronics (South Korea): Samsung has extensive semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and could potentially increase its production to cover some of the demand, but this would require significant investment and time. Other global semiconductor manufacturers: Other companies, such as Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, or Infineon, could potentially increase their production or expand into new areas, but they would face similar challenges as Intel and Samsung. US Government initiatives: The U.S. government has been taking steps to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This includes proposed funding and incentives for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing through legislation like the CHIPS for America Act. Global cooperation: Other countries and regions, including Europe and Japan, are also interested in expanding their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Global cooperation could help mitigate the impact of a potential disruption in Taiwan. However, it's important to note that any mitigation efforts would face significant challenges and would likely take several years to have a substantial impact. The most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as those used by TSMC to produce 5nm and 3nm chips, are incredibly complex and difficult to replicate. Additionally, expanding semiconductor manufacturing capabilities would require significant investment, a highly skilled workforce, and an extensive supplier network. As such, it's unlikely that any entity could fully cover a significant disruption in Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing in the short term. Then I looked at Intel's stock, sitting at like ~$30, less than half of what it was two years ago with basically the same balance sheet, and started wondering, am I missing something here?

,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor; I barely know how to read. Russia updated the existing playbook re: how to invade a neighboring country without getting the US involved. At this point, it doesn't seem to be ""whether"" China will invade Taiwan, it's more like ""when"". And apparently Taiwan and semiconductors have some sort of relationship. So I asked ChatGPT, ""Who has technology, know-how, resources, etc. to actually try to cover a potential loss of semiconductors or increase in prices?"" Semiconductor manufacturing is a highly specialized and capital-intensive industry, and it cannot be quickly or easily ramped up in response to sudden geopolitical changes. The technology, knowledge, and infrastructure required to build advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities (also known as fabs) can take years, if not decades, to develop and billions of dollars in investment. If China were to invade Taiwan, potentially disrupting the operations of major Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), it would have a significant impact on the global semiconductor supply chain, including the U.S. market. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following entities might potentially step in to mitigate such a disruption: Intel Corporation (USA): Intel has been investing heavily in its manufacturing capabilities and announced in 2021 that it plans to become a major provider of foundry services in the U.S. and Europe. However, as of 2021, Intel's foundry capabilities are not yet on par with TSMC's in terms of the most advanced processes. Samsung Electronics (South Korea): Samsung has extensive semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and could potentially increase its production to cover some of the demand, but this would require significant investment and time. Other global semiconductor manufacturers: Other companies, such as Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, or Infineon, could potentially increase their production or expand into new areas, but they would face similar challenges as Intel and Samsung. US Government initiatives: The U.S. government has been taking steps to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This includes proposed funding and incentives for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing through legislation like the CHIPS for America Act. Global cooperation: Other countries and regions, including Europe and Japan, are also interested in expanding their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Global cooperation could help mitigate the impact of a potential disruption in Taiwan. However, it's important to note that any mitigation efforts would face significant challenges and would likely take several years to have a substantial impact. The most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as those used by TSMC to produce 5nm and 3nm chips, are incredibly complex and difficult to replicate. Additionally, expanding semiconductor manufacturing capabilities would require significant investment, a highly skilled workforce, and an extensive supplier network.
