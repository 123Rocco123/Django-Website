As far as cpus go, Intel has everything to lose while AMD has everything to gain. Case in point, datacenter. EPYC is uncontested and AMD is taking huge chunks of Intel's datacenter marketshare at will every quarter.Intel is only competitive because their chips use an insane amount more power than AMD. 13900K @ 253w = 7950X @ 142w. Thats far more than just a node advantage and not remotely close. AMD has the superior architecture, not Intel.ARC is NOT competitive with AMD and Nvidia. You can't compare Intel's flagship to 3 year old AMD and Nvidia entry level gpus and claim that. The 770 is roughly on par with competition flagships from 8-9 years ago.

Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.4- profits are going to decrease tremendously…. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry….how will they compete but on cost?5- Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI? The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space…. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?6- This post makes me want to 🤢 🤮.

Their Tower Semi, Altera and foundry plays are going to do well. Note MOST semiconductors are not leading edge and driven by Moore's Law reductions. Older fabs print money.Their ARC GPU's are a decent first effort but in Intel fashion - late to the party. Their drivers are a hot mess and it will be 3 years before they are on par with NVIDIA or AMD. Note ARC has no AI/Tensorcores which is what is making NVIDIA the winner. Intels AI is damn good but is not showing the commitment needed. With regard to datacenter, Intel is a chip player. Nvidia is a chip player and box and network builder. Intel has all the pieces but fails to execute. I have to wonder if they are handicapped by NOT competing against their customers. As for their customers - ARM (which Intel had and dumped on Marvell) is King of the Core. Most server farm (especially virtualization) is ARM based. Alibaba made their own server chip (128 cores/ 128 PCI lanes supporting 16 GPUS) which leaves Intel in the dust.IMHO Intel has indecisive, risk averse leadership and really poor marketing vision right now. Note it has NEVER had the latter and lived off the PC cash cow business but that is faltering as people are using their PC's much longer and do more and more on tablets and smartphone apps.",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0

They have messed up most of their big projects for a quarter of a century.Remember Itanium (aka Merced) ? Meanwhile AMD leapfrogged them in the 64 bit space.What was that division they started to make chips for digital televisions and ended up folding after less than a year ? At the time, the NYT ran a story about the prototypes being turned into a very expensive disco ball.What about mobile ? There was an effort at Intel to get x86 chips into Android devices. I am vaguely familiar with it because the company I worked for at the time in the mobile space, was solicited to test one of their chips . Nothing came of it. I think some Samsung 10 inch tablet did use an x86 Intel processor but it also contained some hardware so it could run ARM code.Speaking of ARM, they've lost the Apple market. And it wouldn't surprise me if, over the next couple of years, Microsoft also ramped up their support for ARM.Even in the data center, there are companies playing with non x86 architectures. And Moore's Law having slowed down significantly since the early 2000's, for some players, general purpose processors aren't cutting it anymore.Intel's last quarter of a century has been an unmitigated disaster. They survive thanks to their legacy businesses, none of which are safe. Management has been uniformly incompetent. Thankfully they didn't spin off their manufacturing or they'd.already be dead.So given all this, what's different now to make you think Intel's future is brighter than its past ?",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
