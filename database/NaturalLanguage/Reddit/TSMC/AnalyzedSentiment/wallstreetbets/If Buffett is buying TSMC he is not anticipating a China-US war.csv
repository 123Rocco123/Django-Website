China has more issues to deal with at home and a war with Taiwan could be very costly. Chinas military isn’t even close to the capacity the US can operate at. They have almost no navy and a war with the US would end years of economic growth. They need us just as much as we need them. Chinas real estate bubble is huge and is weighing the CCP down. They have a water crisis and don’t have a viable vaccine to fend off covid. They also refuse to import western vaccines. The semiconductor embargo will also hurt China really bad.

If they really are serious what’s stopping them from just blockading Taiwan and or just sieging it over extended periods of time without directly invading it until agreements are made? If that were to happen and foreign players intervene because Taiwan is losing and things escalate it would be mutual destruction. This isn’t the 1980s anymore where you just sail a big boat down and there’s nothing foreign nations can do to stop you. It’s 2022, China has warships and missiles that can be used and although they may not be top of the line the USA still has to refuel and reallocate resources. China just has to keep lobbing missiles/materials over to a country that’s basically just next door. To stop that the countries assisting Taiwan would probably need to invade which would lead to you know what down the line if talking the situation down wasn’t on the table. Ukraine has the benefit of being right next to supportive EU countries and near Russian borders, but Taiwan is literally an island right next to an aggressor by its self. It’s kind of hard to hide a huge warship/plane that’s landing in Taiwan to provide supplies, I imagine they’d try to shoot it down/sink it before it docked/lands.",4,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
