,"TLDR: NVDA will likely beat the low-ball $5.9B and raise guidance for next quarter easily... 4090 GPUs are selling in hot demand after absolutely shattering the gaming records set by the 3090 last year at the same price point. The selling prices right now are >$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. Although NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule. If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind. People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. NVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. There are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei.

A new 3060 ti for $450 is what I went with. I have plenty of money, but I can't justify spending more than ~$800+ on a GPU. I think the prices are insane for Nvidia's cards and think they shot themselves in the foot. A 3060 ti is usually more than enough for 99% of games at 1080p, which is what most people are still on.I'll be surprised if they beat earnings. Very few people are buying 4090 GPUs, and people overall have less disposable income.The only CPU/GPU company I think we will see clearly beat earnings is Intel. Their new 13th generation CPUs are arguably better for most use cases than AMD chips, and they cost quite a bit less than the AMD chips competing at each price point.Also, apparently Intel Arc GPUs are selling fairly well, based on rumors.I'm biased against Nvidia right now though. They took advantage of the market when crypto was still gobbling up GPUs.

If you build a system with 13th gen Intel or Zen 4, coupled with a 4090 graphics card, your system is using quite a bit of power nowadays, ie playing a game for a number of hours can easily start adding up with current electricity prices.My guess is that in 5-10 years the only thing people have at home is a monitor with a thin client, and games are simply played in a cloud where you pay for a subscription. Datacenters have an inherent issue and that is that nobody wants to house them, so space is at a premium and increasing power density will be crucial for manufacturers of GPUs / 3D accelerator cards. So I am expecting this market to grow exponentially, the 4090 and it's datacenter counterparts are simply a byproduct of this.",1,0.512,POSITIVE,0.91

Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. Although NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products.
