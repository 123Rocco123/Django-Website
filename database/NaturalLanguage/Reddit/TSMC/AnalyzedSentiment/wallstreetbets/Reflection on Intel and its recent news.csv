,"To those who are praying for Intel selling IFS. Intel shouldn't even be splitting the company into 2. IDM has always and will be the biggest possibility for Intel to come back to the top. What they need to think is how to lower the cost of manufacturing. To me, they shouldn't be freezing Germany fabs, they should stopped it. Building the fabs in preparation of Intel 18A while they are the lifeblood of next-gen products are just detrimental to the health of the company. They are going to move majority of the products in house. That means a ton of wafer that is going to be needed. Where can they be build? Currently it seems like much investment have to be made ahead of time, which hurts profit margin so much. Intel should just license their 18A process node to Samsung, and let Samsung compete with TSMC. What Intel needs the most, is to have a better cost structure. Outsourcing the manufacturing part to Samsung, and keep low-footprint of manufacturing and R&D is the only way to go. Samsung is backed by a nation, Intel doesn't. Samsung is making profit from the current memory shortage, Intel doesn't. Samsung sucks at latest process node technology, Intel doesn't. Hence, Intel should just let Samsung to be the franchisee of 18A, Intel 3, and possibly any future gen. It's too costly for them to even consider to build in US. None of them (govn't, companies) are supporting it with real dollars. So why should Pat Gelsinger even has the thought of doing so? CHIPS act is not enough until there is a second bill. And Intel can no longer afford it. Franchisee 18A has a couple of benefits.  Samsung offers the cheapest price out of the 3, Intel can pay the best price for each wafer manufactured while being design compatible because Samsung want their first whale customer just like Intel beside itself. Intel has the volume and partnership to negotiate an even lower price than maybe Apple does with TSMC. It's costly to expand new fabs, and next-gen products need 18A capacity so bad. Count the products, Panther lake, Clearwater forest, Falcon Shores, next Rapid, existing 3-party fabless customers Intel should keep growing its packaging revenue as that is easier to scale. It requires less money and less resources while there are plenty of demands. Put less money in fab; while more in packaging. Don't give out everything to Samsung. Outsource a portion of your business to grow your revenue and margin more quickly. To Intel management, investors aren't going to give you more times for what you want to accomplish. Do you want a 50/50 split of manufacturing footprint? Or do you want 60/40 margin ahead of 2030. You are fighting 3 wars at same time, and that won't be easy. All requires resources, while IFS requires the most. You can reorient your business while being IDM. TSMC isn't going to let your margin be saved, find a partner, Samsung. Don't bet foolishly on Germany, or Ohio. Outsource your 18A to Samsung to keep your future products saved. And to have your margin grows ahead of 2030. That's what investors are asking for. Not some 50/50 split on footprint. That is just foolish! Don’t cut Altera, and you don’t need the money to build fabs. Who know where you are in four years? Maybe Intel you are dead. Don’t over promise the fabs. Think smart. Every investment you have reinvested so far has not been that good. 3. Beside TSMC, Samsung has the most EUVs. And Intel doesn't need high-NA for their 18A. Current EUV should be enough. Samsung can just 'Copy Exactly' Intel's fabs. The whole process can be done literally in months, not waiting for fab shell readiness, equipments, technicians. You are in a very dynamic market, Pat Gelsinger, you didn’t anticipate PC crash in sales after COVID, you didn’t anticipate ongoing AI boom. Don’t lock yourself inside a box. You need flexibility. Being in this debt burden isn’t going to help you, Intel, or us the investors. For Intel management again. Act fast, act quick, reduce workforce if you need to, STOP THE CAPEX, FIND A PARTNER, DELIVER YOUR PRODUCTS, and achieve that 60/40 margin goal by 2026. You need one year from now on to have a competitive products in all segments to be able to get that margin again. Don’t miss your schedule.",GPT-REEEE,0,nan,nan,nan

Building the fabs in preparation of Intel 18A while they are the lifeblood of next-gen products are just detrimental to the health of the company. They are going to move majority of the products in house. That means a ton of wafer that is going to be needed. Where can they be build? Currently it seems like much investment have to be made ahead of time, which hurts profit margin so much. Intel should just license their 18A process node to Samsung, and let Samsung compete with TSMC. What Intel needs the most, is to have a better cost structure. Outsourcing the manufacturing part to Samsung, and keep low-footprint of manufacturing and R&D is the only way to go. Samsung is backed by a nation, Intel doesn't. Samsung is making profit from the current memory shortage, Intel doesn't. Samsung sucks at latest process node technology, Intel doesn't. Hence, Intel should just let Samsung to be the franchisee of 18A, Intel 3, and possibly any future gen. It's too costly for them to even consider to build in US. None of them (govn't, companies) are supporting it with real dollars. So why should Pat Gelsinger even has the thought of doing so? CHIPS act is not enough until there is a second bill. And Intel can no longer afford it. Franchisee 18A has a couple of benefits.  Samsung offers the cheapest price out of the 3, Intel can pay the best price for each wafer manufactured while being design compatible because Samsung want their first whale customer just like Intel beside itself. Intel has the volume and partnership to negotiate an even lower price than maybe Apple does with TSMC. It's costly to expand new fabs, and next-gen products need 18A capacity so bad. Count the products, Panther lake, Clearwater forest, Falcon Shores, next Rapid, existing 3-party fabless customers Intel should keep growing its packaging revenue as that is easier to scale. It requires less money and less resources while there are plenty of demands. Put less money in fab; while more in packaging. Don't give out everything to Samsung. Outsource a portion of your business to grow your revenue and margin more quickly. To Intel management, investors aren't going to give you more times for what you want to accomplish. Do you want a 50/50 split of manufacturing footprint? Or do you want 60/40 margin ahead of 2030. You are fighting 3 wars at same time, and that won't be easy. All requires resources, while IFS requires the most. You can reorient your business while being IDM. TSMC isn't going to let your margin be saved, find a partner, Samsung. Don't bet foolishly on Germany, or Ohio. Outsource your 18A to Samsung to keep your future products saved. And to have your margin grows ahead of 2030. That's what investors are asking for. Not some 50/50 split on footprint. That is just foolish! Don’t cut Altera, and you don’t need the money to build fabs. Who know where you are in four years? Maybe Intel you are dead. Don’t over promise the fabs. Think smart. Every investment you have reinvested so far has not been that good. 3. Beside TSMC, Samsung has the most EUVs. And Intel doesn't need high-NA for their 18A. Current EUV should be enough. Samsung can just 'Copy Exactly' Intel's fabs. The whole process can be done literally in months, not waiting for fab shell readiness, equipments, technicians. You are in a very dynamic market, Pat Gelsinger, you didn’t anticipate PC crash in sales after COVID, you didn’t anticipate ongoing AI boom. Don’t lock yourself inside a box. You need flexibility. Being in this debt burden isn’t going to help you, Intel, or us the investors. For Intel management again. Act fast, act quick, reduce workforce if you need to, STOP THE CAPEX, FIND A PARTNER, DELIVER YOUR PRODUCTS, and achieve that 60/40 margin goal by 2026. You need one year from now on to have a competitive products in all segments to be able to get that margin again. Don’t miss your schedule.","Basically, good luck surpassing TSM while they are SO ahead in this space",1,nan,nan,nan

However unless they put a manufacturing genius on their management, there is no way to compate with tsmc. Taiwan is basically almost like china, except some respect to IPs of their customers.I think, apart from delivering good products, there is no place for Intel in this economy.They have good knowledge already.they should get rid of the higher management team, and find people who knows the industry, and attract talented people to the r&d team.",0,nan,nan,nan
