,"Like we all saw how Apple grew over the years and same as with chipset companies like Nvidia, TSMC or ASML. But they grew a lot after COVID, do you think their valuations are high or there is still room to grow more in 10 years and why ?",I think much of chipset companies grew because of introduction of AI in daily consumer products.

It could be that 1T becomes the new 100/200B, in which case they could grow heaps.
