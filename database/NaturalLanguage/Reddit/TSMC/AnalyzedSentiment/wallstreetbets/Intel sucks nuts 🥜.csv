As They will also never set up the best chips foundary in the US, obviously.Fund 1 non cutting edge foundary that is still making 12/14 nm chips but has given up on making smaller than 12 nm chips. If you are laughing at intel , you should laugh more at gfs.Or give most of the money to intel to try and shift more chip production back to USA.Either way, chip production is gonna shift more to asia accrodingt to trend, why would anyone would want to set up expensive foundries eith expensive labour cost in the US is beyond me.",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0

And RISC or CISC on the other hand has fixed length instructions with a fixed amount of operands - or of them may not be used, but instruction decoding is much faster cause all you need to do is add a fixed size to your program counter.
