,"Preface Listen up regards, on April 7th, Samsung posted its Q1 2023 guidance. In-case you were hiding under your mom's bed from her drunk bf that day, the results were worse than abysmal. Here is the headline you need to know according to the WSJ: Samsung Forecasts Worst Profit in Over a Decade as Tech Slump Hits Memory Chips. From $59 Billion rev. to $48 Billion year-over-year (YoY). A whopping -19% year-over-year drop. From $10.7 Billion operating profit to $455 Million YoY. -95.6%. That's a lot and it's the worst profit results since 2009 (percentage wise still less than what some of you regards lose on 0dte). Did I also mention Samsung commands a 15.8% global marketshare of semis (http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=110893) As a result, Samsung declared ""meaningful"" cuts into production. ANALysts interpreted this as a win for Micron, which saw a ridiculous rally of 8% on April 10th, which has since melted away its gains as of April 25th. I hope you bought puts. I did. What else happened leading up to April 10th? IDC released its Q1 2023 report (https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723) which saw PC manufacturers shipping less computers YoY by an average of -29%. Apple was the star of this report, shipping -40.5% less computers. It just keeps getting worse on April 10th, as TSMC reported its first drop in monthly revenue in almost four years. (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tsmc-posts-first-revenue-drop-in-nearly-four-years-a020fe58) Yeah you read that right, the same TSMC that Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway had recently liquidated 86% out of. (https://www.reuters.com/technology/buffett-says-geopolitics-factor-berkshire-sale-tsmc-stake-2023-04-11/) Fast forward to April 20h, where we have TSMC's earnings. While the bottom line EPS was a beat ($1.31 vs $1.21), its top line rev was $16.7 Billion, missing estimates of $17.3 Billion. TSMC's Q2 guidance came in between $15.2 and $16 Billion. With all this shit guidance, you can't ignore what lay ahead. After all, semis requires a metric ton of capital. Foundries ain't cheap to build and operate, and you know what else ain't cheap? Interest rates, and we've yet begun to price it in. See where I'm going here? What's the deal? Looking at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index $SOX, it's clear it's running out of steam. Having formed a bearish divergence against the RSI, I'm expecting the worst. Don't believe me? Look at the charts for other semis - AMD, NVDA, INTC (lolz), QCOM, etc. Since my wife's bf won't let me gamble options anymore in any serious capacity, I've resorted to triple leveraged ETFs so I can lose money three times as fast. I present to you SOXS. My position? 1000 shares at a cost average of $19.66. Thank you. Edit: minor grammatical correction",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
