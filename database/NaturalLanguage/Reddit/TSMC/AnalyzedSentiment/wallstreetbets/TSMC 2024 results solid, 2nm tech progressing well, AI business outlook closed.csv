,"In November 2024, TSMC sales reached $8.834 billion, up 34 per cent year-on-year This year-on-year decline has sparked market concerns about data centre build-outs, although overall demand for AI chips remains strong The cumulative total for January to November 2024 was $83.717 billion, up 31.8 per cent year-on-year With Bloomberg analyst Charles Shum noting that TSMC dominance in pricing power has further solidified its market Although November sales were slightly below my forecast (up 36.3% y/y) TSMC technological progress on the 2nm process has been impressive. The company has been working on the 2nm process at its Hsinchu Baoshan plant and expects to reach a monthly capacity of 20,000 wafers completed by the end of 2025 for the N2 process. Although the current yield of 2nm chips is 60%, which is lower than the 70% standard required for large-scale mass production, TSMC plans to formally enter the mass production stage in 2025, which is expected to be the future of high-end chips With the recent surge in Apple's stock price, Apple is one of TSMC important customers, a media revealed that Apple products with 2nm chips 2026 iPhone 19 series is expected to be equipped with 2nm memory Apple's iPhone 17 series will continue to use TSMC 3nm process based A19/Pro processor However, TSMC future remains full of potential thanks to its leading position in 2nm process technology and its close cooperation with large customers such as Apple. The continued growth of its AI business and the mass production of high-end chips are expected to bring strong revenue growth to the company, and the stock is expected to have significant upside in the future. Compared to Samsung, TSMC is leading the way in terms of 2nm process yields and technological advances. Samsung's 2nm chips currently have yields of around 10-20 per cent, while TSMC is expected to start mass production of its 2nm chips in 2025 and become a key technology supplier for Apple products. This has led TSMC to receive increasing attention in the global semiconductor market As a long-term investor, TSMC AI business revenue is expected to grow by 30-40 per cent in 2025.

,"In November 2024, TSMC sales reached $8.834 billion, up 34 per cent year-on-year This year-on-year decline has sparked market concerns about data centre build-outs, although overall demand for AI chips remains strong The cumulative total for January to November 2024 was $83.717 billion, up 31.8 per cent year-on-year With Bloomberg analyst Charles Shum noting that TSMC dominance in pricing power has further solidified its market Although November sales were slightly below my forecast (up 36.3% y/y) TSMC technological progress on the 2nm process has been impressive. The company has been working on the 2nm process at its Hsinchu Baoshan plant and expects to reach a monthly capacity of 20,000 wafers completed by the end of 2025 for the N2 process. Although the current yield of 2nm chips is 60%, which is lower than the 70% standard required for large-scale mass production, TSMC plans to formally enter the mass production stage in 2025, which is expected to be the future of high-end chips With the recent surge in Apple's stock price, Apple is one of TSMC important customers, a media revealed that Apple products with 2nm chips 2026 iPhone 19 series is expected to be equipped with 2nm memory Apple's iPhone 17 series will continue to use TSMC 3nm process based A19/Pro processor However, TSMC future remains full of potential thanks to its leading position in 2nm process technology and its close cooperation with large customers such as Apple. The continued growth of its AI business and the mass production of high-end chips are expected to bring strong revenue growth to the company, and the stock is expected to have significant upside in the future. Compared to Samsung, TSMC is leading the way in terms of 2nm process yields and technological advances. Samsung's 2nm chips currently have yields of around 10-20 per cent, while TSMC is expected to start mass production of its 2nm chips in 2025 and become a key technology supplier for Apple products. This has led TSMC to receive increasing attention in the global semiconductor market As a long-term investor, TSMC AI business revenue is expected to grow by 30-40 per cent in 2025. As demand for AI chips expands, TSMC will continue to benefit from technological advances and growing market demand. I personally expect TSMC shares to reach $240 by March 2025, mainly due to its strong market position and future growth potential","Orange or not. ASML - 2 nm wouldn’t happen. They tanked on their legacy equipment sales, but big days ahead.",0,0.568,NEGATIVE,0.873
