,"I'm buying Intel little by little every month. I'm reading up on the stock prices, the bankruptcy, the corporate greed and raw failures, and just buying the snot out of this stock. Why. Why would any sane person do this? TSMC and NVDIA are crushing the market, and deservedly so. Intel doesn't deserve any place in the world stage for technology any more as admitted by Intel, and evidenced by better chip makers. Hell Samsung would be a better bet (regardless that us plebs can't buy it). I'm buying it because..... and this hurts to admit, because of the conspiracy theory that China is going to go into Taiwan. Yes all stock prices will drop, yes this includes Intel, but there are too many red flags. This is a 5-10 year bet. I have no idea if it'll play out, but then again Warren Buffet does suggest to be greedy when everyone else is revolted and running (for good reason too Intel wtf). Am I a regard or just mad?
