,"First DD so go ez on me lol. TLDR at the end. NFA Wanna make ez money? Well TSMC’s earnings report on the 18th is gonna be a very noice 8-15% jump on their stock price. I was waiting to put this out until after April 10th because of the Monthly Earnings which might have been impacted by the earthquake, but all is still good according to them so here we go. -----Revenue----- 1st quarter revenue is crazy good. January up 7.9% Y-o-Y February up 11.3% Y-o-Y March up 34.3% Y-o-Y March 2023 was pretty bad last year, but she stepped up big time this year with some very nice Y-o-Y gains. In the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above, January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y, very good Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC’s size. It gets better though. Looking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report, revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars. Using the above guidance and converting NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024, pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers. -----EPS----- Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ? Absolutely. If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far. The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now. In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves. Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks: TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150 thru 160 calls you should make a pretty decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

January up 7.9% Y-o-Y February up 11.3% Y-o-Y March up 34.3% Y-o-Y March 2023 was pretty bad last year, but she stepped up big time this year with some very nice Y-o-Y gains. In the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above, January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y, very good Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC’s size. It gets better though. Looking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report, revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars. Using the above guidance and converting NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024, pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers. -----EPS----- Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ? Absolutely. If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far. The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now. In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves. Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks: TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150 thru 160 calls you should make a pretty decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy","Am one such regard!

In the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above, January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y, very good Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC’s size. It gets better though. Looking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report, revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars. Using the above guidance and converting NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024, pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers. -----EPS----- Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ? Absolutely. If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far. The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now. In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves. Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks: TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150 thru 160 calls you should make a pretty decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy",I shouldn’t have sold this morning 🙃🤣,0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.994

I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers. -----EPS----- Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ? Absolutely. If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far. The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now. In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves. Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks: TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150 thru 160 calls you should make a pretty decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy","That's my bad, I thought I was replying to somebody else lol.

And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far. The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now. In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day.

I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers. -----EPS----- Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ? Absolutely. If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far. The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now. In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves. Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks: TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150 thru 160 calls you should make a pretty decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy","Yea, but TSMC's infrastructure wasn't significantly impacted.",1,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.973

In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2% With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45, beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%. -----STONK PRICE----- How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price? Over 10% Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves. Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks: TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150 thru 160 calls you should make a pretty decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy","Yeah, I took a small bet on it and when I saw it down >60% I was like oh nah this ain't good -sell-",2,0.51,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"First DD so go ez on me lol. TLDR at the end. NFA Wanna make ez money? Well TSMC’s earnings report on the 18th is gonna be a very noice 8-15% jump on their stock price. I was waiting to put this out until after April 10th because of the Monthly Earnings which might have been impacted by the earthquake, but all is still good according to them so here we go. -----Revenue----- 1st quarter revenue is crazy good. January up 7.9% Y-o-Y February up 11.3% Y-o-Y March up 34.3% Y-o-Y March 2023 was pretty bad last year, but she stepped up big time this year with some very nice Y-o-Y gains. In the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above, January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y, very good Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC’s size. It gets better though. Looking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report, revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars. Using the above guidance and converting NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024, pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers. -----EPS----- Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ?
