,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE? Cheers.","More volume=smaller spread. The longer you’ll hold, the more amplification of cost differences because of compounding growth (same with interests).",0,nan,nan,nan
