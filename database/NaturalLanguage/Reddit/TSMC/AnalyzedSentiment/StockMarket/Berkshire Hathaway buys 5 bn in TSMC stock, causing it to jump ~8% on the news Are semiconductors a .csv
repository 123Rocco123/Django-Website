,nan,"If you have read Buffet's books, he tends to continuosly add to his positions over a 5 to 10 year period after taking a new position in a stock.TSM is a cash rich business with a moat that none can beat on this planet. What investors worried over was geopolitical rather than financial. It is a strong, stable company.Smart people are slowly realizing the next civilization is built on microchips. In times of peace, we get robotics, spaceships, game consoles, electric vehicles and many gadgets. In times of war, we get submarines, ships, jets, drones, rockets. What do they all have in common? The technology layer for all of it are built with TSM products. All of humanity's next generation inventions will also be full of microchips.Buffet's team has nearly a century of experience, they get the significance of TSM. Keep adding it to your portfolio as the hardware foundational technology play. His researches are rarely wrong. üòçüëçüíöüíØ",0,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"He can buy with the money he had ripped off from average Americans with his Wells Fargo holdings. If you love Buffet investing you should read up on the Wells Fargo ongoing, never ending, quarterly fraud on customers of that bank. Might make you think twice about him. And no I don‚Äôt bank there, I just think it needs to be said for all the people Wells Fargo rip off.",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,They are building so many chip plants in the US that there may be a glut one day.,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"It entirely depends on what type of foundry it is. There are broadly, 3 categories of chips; memory, logic, and analog (MCU)Memory is highly cyclical, this is the category that we hear gluts about all the time. Analogs and MCUs are the one that are sufferring from chronic global shortages. Logic is the most stable category; not that volatile",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Highly doubtful in the near future. Catching up in advanced chip manufacturing is not as easy as flipping a switch or building a plant(for basic chips, this is not the case). TSM is years ahead of basically everyone except Samsung. While chips are extremely cyclical and do have gluts and shortages by nature, over the next few decades we are going to have orders of magnitude more chip manufacturing than today.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I‚Äôve been into amd and tsm for a couple years and also have been looking into asml.,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"same, but i think like amd growth is pretty much over. I think ARM Tsmc and ASML will be the future. Take a look at ARM they‚Äôre currently owned by SoftBank but might go public next year.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Buffet must think China isn‚Äôt going to invade Taiwan or escalate the situation. I think there will be better opportunity to buy TSMC lower in the next two years. Semis are cyclical. Don‚Äôt think this is the bottom of the cycle for variety of reasons.,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Semiconductors might be volatile but in the long term they can only go up. Everything these days is getting more complex with more edge compute capability.,0,nan,nan,nan
