,"I bought some Stellantis stock last week. With production and markets spanning the globe and with a heavy focus on EV's I can see them increasing their valuation as already the 4th largest automaker. The auto industry was hit with a massive chip shortage and TSMC stepped in. With such a large dependence on one countries production, and one that has a tenuous relationship and proximity to China. It seems like a western Semiconductor producer would be very worthwhile. Just looking for some information and discussion around what the future holds for western Semiconductor production.","From what I understand the backlog isn't at the chip manufacturers, but actually further up the supply chain. There is a specific material that all the foundries are waiting on, and it's mostly made by a few small Taiwanese companies that aren't traded in US markets. So I think that's why auto makers aren't switching providers. They'll just get the same answer from the competition.That said, chip makers do have massive order backlogs and should have a good year once production picks up.",0,nan,nan,nan

The whole point is to make a chip cheaper and more powerful. I wouldn’t touch a semi company.Source: Worked at a semiconductor company in the US. Balance sheet was a mess. Company had a good product, but it’s just immensely hard to stay profitable consistently while also making a cheaper more competitive product.",0,nan,nan,nan

That’s literally the margins every company that sells a product wants. That idea is not limited to semiconductors lol.They literally are selling their inventory before they can even make them, that’s about as good as it gets from a business standpoint.",1,nan,nan,nan

Semis scale so well that by its nature there is a strong tendency of consolidation by the largest player. And the cost of remaining competitive is so high I doubt anyone will do it just for strategic reasons.,0,nan,nan,nan
