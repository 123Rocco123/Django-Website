,"Does anyone know which broker i can use in europe to invest every month in an ETF composed of several Integrated Circuits and AI companies? I would like to invest in one of this list: SOXX (iShares Semiconductor ETF) SMH (VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF) SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares) PSI (Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF) USD (ProShares Ultra Semiconductors) you can consult the reports/data of these various ETFs here. I really believe that in the long run it will give me a lot of profits, ie integrated circuits, cpus, gpus, sensors and hardware accelerators are our past, present and will be our future !! These ETFs have shares of AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx, NXP, Microchip, Texas Instruments, Maxim Integrated, ASML, TSMC, qorvo, STMicroeletronics... Will my only solution be to create a pie on the T212 broker similar to these ETFs and invest there? I don't like the T212 very much because they are still very amateur and don't support several important features like merges. For example, if I acquire shares of AMD and Xilinx and AMD's acquisition of Xilinx goes through, they won't be able to merge and sell as my shares of Xilinx without telling me like how it happened to several people holding shares in Tilray and Apharia.",I think you can use InteractiveBrokers,0,nan,nan,nan
