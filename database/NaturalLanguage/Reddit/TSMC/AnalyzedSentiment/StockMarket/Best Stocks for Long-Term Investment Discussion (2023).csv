,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",Google yesNot sure about the rest ðŸ˜•,0,nan,nan,nan

Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird.

For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",Tesla is a speculative play. Elon has been lucky so far. Got good accountant. That was the most profitable stock I held and became worst performing. Selling cc for income. Reduced the position.TSMC can be a late entry. Probably too late. Wait US built advanced wafer plants in and TSMC and Twn both will be forgotton.,0,nan,nan,nan

Buying NVDIA right now is a dumb decision its at a 13 week high, iâ€™m waiting for a pullback. I wonder how many times people have said TSLA is just a car company without doing actual research.

In my experience, these can often turn out to be the best investments. Let me give you a couple of examples.When my electrician installed my Generac generator, I noticed some wires on the ground that he had cut up to get the generator running. Upon closer inspection, I found the manufacturer's name on the wires: Atkore. This company has consistently demonstrated growing free cash flow, EPS, revenue, and net income over the past decade. With a Total Debt/Equity (mrq) ratio of 64.08% and a remarkable Return on Equity of 69%, Atkore shows impressive financial strength. Moreover, its price-to-earnings ratio is currently at a five-year low, standing at less than 8. The company also boasts a 4/5 star rating on Glassdoor.Another intriguing discovery I made was when I came across some unique copper pipes and tubes while browsing at Home Depot. Curiosity led me to research the manufacturer, which turned out to be Mueller Industries, Inc. (MLI). Similar to Atkore, Mueller Industries' products are highly valued, used in pools and behind the walls in houses. Just like Atkore, this company has exhibited long-term earnings and revenue growth, maintaining low valuations, low debt, and a healthy cash position.These are the kind of hidden gems that you stumble upon when you keep your eyes open and pay attention to the products around you. They may not be the companies making headlines every day, but that gives them the opportunity to be undervalued. I'm cautious about mentioning these names, but I'm always eager to share financial education and help people make smarter financial decisions.I hope this insight proves useful to you.
