,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing. Customers will run first to mass-producing cutting-edge technology first. Which of the two will win. It's a really exciting showdown in the long run. https://canarygreen.tistory.com/257",so buy ASML,0,nan,nan,nan
