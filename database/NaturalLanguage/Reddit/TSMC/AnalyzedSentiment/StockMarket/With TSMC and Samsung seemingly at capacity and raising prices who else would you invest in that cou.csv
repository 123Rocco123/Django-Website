,TSMC - Ending discounts and increasing prices Intel seems to be treading water. Who else do you guys like in this space? Any potential suppliers or contractors that could help expand capacity? Any another up and coming fabs?,"There is no other foundry at the leading edge (7/5nm).The next best thing would be UMC (10nm).SMIC has comparable technology but they just got placed on the entity list, so risky.",0,nan,nan,nan

Any another up and coming fabs?,Not true. Global Foundries (GloFo) is also top tier.SMIC is not in the same class. They produce lots of cheaper chips but aren’t really leading edge.,1,nan,nan,nan

Any another up and coming fabs?,GF is private so good luck investing. Also gave up 7nm development and sold all their EUV machines. SMIC is a bit behind UMC but catching up.,2,nan,nan,nan

Any another up and coming fabs?,"Yah I was saddened by the 7nm thing. GloFo’s 7nm (developed by IBM research) looked more promising than what TSMC was running, but I guess they couldn’t attract enough customers to fund the capital buildout :(",3,nan,nan,nan

Any another up and coming fabs?,Isn’t tsmc building a new fab in Arizona? I’d expect them to build multiple fabs there eventually. Wish I had grabbed their stock when is was around ~$50 mid year.,0,nan,nan,nan
