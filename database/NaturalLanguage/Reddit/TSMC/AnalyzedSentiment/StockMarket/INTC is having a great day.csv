,"I’m a believer in the long term health of this amazing company headed by a great CEO! I’m wondering if it has anything to do with Modi’s visit to Russia and the looming Taiwan threat, as it relates to TSMC. Or maybe they’ve figured out that intel will have the most advanced manufacturing capacity in place for the next several years, after having locked out TSMC on the latest lithography (ASML) machines. It broke out on Friday, and it looks like it could get back to its 52 week high pretty quickly. Up 5% 15 minutes into the day.","So my theory is that the last earnings looked bad because they restructured their accounting practices that made things look unfavorable for this period. That restructuring won’t be present this time around.I think larger investors are expecting the report to be favorable, and I’m gonna hold for probably the next few years. Intel has some serious potential. Like Apple/NVIDIA level potential.I believe truly that the principle behind fabless computing is bullshit, it’s just companies hiding on the laurels of intellectual property. That is what killed AT&T, GE, and IBM. Broadcom’s gonna go down eventually as well, it’s just a matter of when.And all these fabless companies will be forced to use Intel Foundry for the next generation of chips as Intel from my understanding bought up all of the next gen lithography machines for the next year or two….and barring any operational failure, they should capture the majority of TSMCs market share. Especially considering the geopolitical risk associated with putting all your eggs in the Taiwan basket…",0,nan,nan,nan

But things are looking up long term.I put 9k down on them a week ago. I'm up 12% now.",0,nan,nan,nan

If you’re looking for an 1+ year investment, relatively low Vega, there’s probably no better company than Intel.And their upside in foundry is huge. From a national defense and interest perspective as well as consumer stuff.",1,nan,nan,nan

Although it will take a little time to take back a decent percentage of the Global chip making, they are starting on all cylinders. Foundries are big business with enormous expense. Intel is building for its future comeback and contribution to this new AI Revolution. There are only three Companies at present capable of this task in the world. Intel is one. The other two are based primarily in Asia. With government subsidies now helping initially, we can look forward to INTEL building an enormous future in the next few years. Their stock price is probably about the lowest you will see at below $36 at this time. A second Chips ACT by the US Fed would greatly enhance this industry in this Country.",0,nan,nan,nan

And will still outperform intel",0,nan,nan,nan
