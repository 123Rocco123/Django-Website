,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals. So, are semiconductors companies good long term investments? ETFs would be better than just TSM?","Yeah I don't see a Taiwan invasion happening.USA, strongest super power in history, just wasted 20 years losing to backwater terrorists (Taliban).Is China going to do better against a modern military with the most modern equipment, probable indirect support from USA, and a mandatory amphibious invasion?Occupation is not easy.",0,nan,nan,nan

Nobody can compete with them in manufacturing and thats why most semis companies focus only on designing chips (high margins) and let TSMC do the manufacture.No company is investing in R&D like they do so don't expect Intel or anyone to come close in terms of manufacturing capabilities.,0,nan,nan,nan

I have been waiting on the sidelines with TSMC because of the ever increasing rhetoric coming out of Beijing that is preparing all of China for war. I like TSMC but see this as a massive risk that not many people talk about.,0,nan,nan,nan

If the Headquarters is destroyed imagine the difficulty in continuing operations. their most advanced chips are produced in Taiwan I believe, which is probably the highest margin portion of their business (i could be wrong on some of this it is just me guessing based on intuition of what i already know about the company)",2,nan,nan,nan
