,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. Some stocks I post may be low market cap. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Why isn’t ___ on the watchlist?” or something answered in the watchlist will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- information is meant to be shared in open discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. TSM / NVDA / AMD / SMH / ASML - Killer earnings by TSMC. Raised target for 2024 revenue growth, projecting sales to increase, reported a 54% rise in quarterly net income. This seems like a complete reversal of the ASML news for the semi sector. TSM CEO’s states “the demand is real and I believe it’s just the beginning”. Currently long NVDA and ASML. EXPE / UBER - Uber reportedly explored acquiring EXPE, but this is rumored, not confirmed. SMR - Up due to AMZN signing 3 agreements for nuclear projects for energy demands (due to AI) yesterday, watching $20 level. Biased short if we hit $20, not interested otherwise. LCID - Prices 262.4M shares in ~$1.67B public offering. HOOD - Launches platform to go after bigger, active traders- don’t anticipate this to be a meaningful catalyst but will still watch at open.
