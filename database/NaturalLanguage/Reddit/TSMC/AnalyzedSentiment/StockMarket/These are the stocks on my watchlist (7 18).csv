,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. Any positions I have stated are not meant to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell, I’m just following subreddit rules of disclosing positions. Some stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: TSMC Hikes Revenue Outlook to Reflect Heated AI Demand TSM - Lifted projections for revenue and profit expectations in Q2, reported earnings last night. Reported net revenue rose from 40.1% a year ago to NT$673.51B, and net income increased 36.3% to NT$247.85B. I’d attribute the bounce in chip stocks today to this earnings report. NVDA - We bounced pretty strongly overnight and we’re back to where we opened yesterday. Currently long. Other chip stocks I’m watching: ASML, AMD, LAM, SMCI, SOXL/SXS (levered chip ETFs), INTC DPZ - Stated it would open fewer stores than expected in its key international markets. Reported quarterly same-store sales below expectations. EPS was 4.03 vs 3.68 expected. UAL - Reported weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue and guidance. Earnings of 4.14 vs 3.98 expected, revenue of 14.99B vs 15.11 expected. WBD - Making more job cuts this week as part of another round of cost-cutting measures. Also discussed plan to split digital streaming/studios from television networks. BYND - Discussing balance-sheet restructuring with bondholders. Earnings: NFLX IPOs: ARDT, TWFG",SoXL is down almost 25% is it worth going in now? This dip seems very reactionary and not based on fundamentals.,0,nan,nan,nan

,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. Any positions I have stated are not meant to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell, I’m just following subreddit rules of disclosing positions. Some stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.

Reported net revenue rose from 40.1% a year ago to NT$673.51B, and net income increased 36.3% to NT$247.85B. I’d attribute the bounce in chip stocks today to this earnings report.
