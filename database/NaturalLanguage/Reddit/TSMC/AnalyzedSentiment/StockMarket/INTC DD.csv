,"Anybody else have any DD on intel? Other than the $20 billion they’re putting into two more fab facilities? I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here. Given everything, and my own speculation, I’m thinking about getting a one way ticket and seeing where it takes me.

Also new fabs take years to go online and longer to work problems out. Fabs are so complex and sensitive that when they go down for even hours, the prices go crazy. Look at the flash memory market for instance",0,nan,nan,nan

They are only now getting into the fondry business.I am sure that this is a good business if Intel can be price competitive as there are only two world class fondries, TSMC and Samsung. Moreover, if I understand it correctly they do have unique technologies which are a couple of years away from production. Once that happens Intel will likely be ahead of TSMC whose technology is licensed from Intel.This will also allow them to reduce their chip cost as their fabrication facilities might have economy of scale.On the other hand, it is possible that they won't be cost competitive, TSMC will remain ahead of them on tech curve, or the new plants will suffer execution hiccups (not totally unlikely).",0,nan,nan,nan

I like Intel for the following reasons:US government needs Intel to be healthy and competitive. It is not like there is any other company they can bet on.They do have very good growth engine, such as 5G OpenRAN, Mobileye, upcoming GPU and government contracts. 5G OpenRAN is near term winner since they have customers like Dish who has to ramp up very quickly.Their fab play is very interesting since they are pushing RISC-V in partnership with SenseFive.

It’s not exactly apples to apples comparison between TSM and INTC since Intel also has chip design along with internal manufacturing. TSM only focuses on manufacturing.TSM vs Intel Foundry Services would be a better comparison once Intel Foundry Services comes online in 2-3 years,0,nan,nan,nan

They didn't seem to comprehend how it works on the back end, on the retail.Will their current management do better? Who cares? If they can't make it work, they'll sell the new foundry and the market will forgive them.This is exactly the sort of thing that Intel needed to do right now. That said, I own AMD, and I'm not going to be buying any Intel. Too many engineering failures for me to forgive. They have a history of recovering from mistakes, but I think there are better tech stocks for the long term; and chip tech is dubious in the short term.👼",0,nan,nan,nan

I have no idea who the management of intel is or their background since I never looked too deep into them but the last time I checked I think they trade somewhere around 11-12x free cash flow so it’s definitely a cheap stock compared to AMD but with AMD you’re buying all of the future growth potential and I definitely believe in Lisa Su,0,nan,nan,nan

This is a company that has been left for dead due to missteps and execution issues, but still is a significant player in a the CPU market as well as adjacent business including FPGA, AI, autonomous, 5G. The last five year revenue trends have been a record each year despite the world is ending thesis on Intel, yet the price underperformance and the hatred on the stock has maintained. While it may not have the limelight that other semiconductors get its a undervalued and potential momentum stock on the cusp of turning.
