,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3.
