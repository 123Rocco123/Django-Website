I have had alot of success and managed to retire really early. I spend alot of time on research, maybe 10 hrs a week average. I have learned to set aside how I value stocks and the market, and focus on what the herd is currently valuing. I have adjusted my strategy from year to year and have had consistent outperformance.",0,nan,nan,nan

You can put 4 billion into Apple without the price moving a single 0.1%. That is what the maga investing is about, you need to invest in something that is big.When you are small, you can afford to blindly put a loan that you have taken to but a car, into some random stock that has huge prospects in the future. If you lose, nothing happens to your life. If you win, you win big.But you cannot do that once you manage even 10 million.",0,nan,nan,nan
