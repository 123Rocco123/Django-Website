,nan,"I don't know if this is good or bad overall. TSMC will be able to supply the entire U.S Demand from these investments. So, what happens to INTC and GlobalFoundaries and TSMC in Taipei?Is this going to create a price war as a result of a glut in supply leading to cheaper end use products? Or, is demand going to continue to outstrip supply resulting in fulfilled orders?My personal prediction is that all the Capex is going to result in a massive glut of capacity in the coming years, reducing profit margins, and price competition. The result will be cheaper products that use semiconductors, increasing downstream margins, but decreasing margins for the actual producers themselves.",0,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"I was honestly also thinking, how exactly does this help anything?The products will still be assembled in China. So, TSMC is going to make them in Arizona, ship them to China, and then ship the finished product back to the US? Seems like this is going to needlessly drive up the costs of finished products.It could increase US exports, I guess.... But, it's really inefficient. I expect this to just increase prices in the long run.",2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,The yields made from new plants on latest technology will be low and will take sometime to ramp up. Some of these smaller players may not be able to sell them at competive price w/o gov/t incentives. Right now none is a worry. Soon over capacity is going to hurt all countries. US Universities also need to train more process engineers from STEM students. Make it in USA is going to be expensive.,0,nan,nan,nan
