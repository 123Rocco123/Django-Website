,"SMH(SemiConductor Industry) Semi-Conductor Industry past 10-year returns. Semi-Conductor Industry has been the best-outperforming industry in the past 10 years and will still remain to outperform other industries because of its high demand globally varying from its uses in Computers to its major uses in the auto sector. Global Forecast for the Semi-Conductor Industry The global semiconductor chip shortage is likely to continue till 2022 before it eases gradually. The global shortage of semiconductor chips has triggered concerns as companies around the world fail to meet the rising demand for a wide range of essential as well as modern tech products. The shortage has intensified over the past couple of months. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs suggested that at least 169 industries have been impacted by the global chip supply shortage. In 2020, the global semiconductor industry reported revenue growth of 6.5% to reach US$440 bn.

It is a huge industry because of the increased chip utilization in practically everything. So production and the capacity to produce must increase significantly. I’d look to the players that are increasing their production capacity rather than who is gaining market share or signing contracts with the big companies.,0,nan,nan,nan

As computing shifts to the cloud and things start becoming more virtual, all that technology will continue to be powered by semiconductors. Electronic drug discovery, ultrasound, genomics, data processing and analytics, data storage, electric vehicles, televisions, phones, consoles, household appliances, digital banking infrastructure, blockchain, it is all powered by semiconductors. Every facet of life in the western world is affected and it will continue to have strong secular tailwinds. I think you will see Chinese and other Asian semiconductor manufacturers and designers explode as well, not just the leaders in the US. Most developing and developed countries will likely make it a strong focus to grow their own domestic industries to prevent exploitation and supply constrictions due to trade wars, supply chain issues, etc.",0,nan,nan,nan

Some people are say it is over priced if you base it on current value. If you base it on 10 year growth, others will say its cheap. Current price targets range from 225 to 300+ depending on who use. After the split there was a sell off. Its been side ways since so I don't see it dipping much more. Only see up in my opinion, but do what's right for you.",4,nan,nan,nan
