A really great assistant coach that can get a HC job elsewhere probably won’t want to coach for a team that was good 10 years ago and hasn’t been good in a decade. Add on to the fact that the team doesn’t have as much talent as the rest of the league, the culture sucks balls, and they might have a couple future high draft picks but the GM or in this case execution continuously fails it makes it hard to even want to take the job.
