,nan,Thanks for sharing. Incredible amount of cash mentioned in that article.,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yep, for some reason people seem to be blind as to just how big the market is and how much money is being invested. I posted this as part of an assessment of money flows in a different subreddit last weekend. I have even read a few more semi investment plans since.Semiconductor fabs and foundries spending plans: Samsung $205B/3yrs, Micron $150B/10yrs, Intel $115B/3yrs, Taiwan Semi $100B/3yrs, United Micro $2B in 2022, SK Hynix $235B/10yrs. Major plays $LRCX, $ASML, $AMAT, $TER. Minor plays $NUE, $X, $CLF, $VMC, $FCX, $URI, $CAT.My favorite quote I read this week that shows just this was from Pat Gelsinger: “I think I have more concrete trucks working for me today than any other human on the planet,” Gelsinger said. “We have construction in Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona, Ireland and Israel. And we expect to plant our next major fabs in the U.S. and Europe before the end of this year.”",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Any thoughts on asx? I believe Financials ate good. Very up in a screen. I don't know much about the industry.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,I have never researched them before but a quick glance was enough for me to add them to my list for deeper evaluation. Nothing screamed to me that they had a huge moat or duopoly so they would likely be a tier 2 kind of holding for me. Thanks for throwing that one out there.,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Yes, the spending is astronomical. But Samsung and TSMC are way ahead and their investments will trail-blaze the path ahead. Tsmc is already building a plant in Arizona (apple will be working closely with them) and Intel is years away. It doesn’t matter though how much money you throw at building a fab; the time it takes is what it is it can’t be sped up. So Intel will be lagging for a couple years at best (that’s if they execute the new foundry specifications perfectly). The processes involved are so delicate rushing is not an option. So much of the inner workings are automated so it’s a one good effort now, pays off residually in nano-point accurate robotic executions. Mess up by a nano anywhere and the systems will break down. TSMC will be carrying the torch for all of us as they have been for decades now.",2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,How does x or clf fit in to microchip plays?,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,They are building very large factories and campuses as part of these new fabs. There is a minor play on all related construction as they build out all of these facilities. There is an ass-ton (scientific unit) of steel and concrete in these kinds of complexes. It is dwarfed by the cost of the fab equipment but it is a minor play. I thought about including the engineering and HVAC companies as those can play a notable role in these buildouts too.,3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"US wafer production has been in decline steadily for over 22 years from 37% to just 12% in recent years citing high cost investment was the primarily reason.Twn has two other lessor know major fab public companies. United which has 12 manufacturing facilities worldwide, employing approximately 19,500 people in Twn, Singapore, Korea and China. Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation (VIS) is 3rd largest.",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Competition for them and Samsung is irrelevant, only they can do the high end stuff and have the know how the push for new advances. Everyone else is just producing low end, relatively old tech except Intel.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"IC background here. Majority of IC used in consumer products do not need the miniaturization and sophistication needed. It is only 200mm mixed signal technology that is experiencing shortage due to bad planning on demand. Frig as your title mentions does not need the sophistication of 5/6 metal layers and can do just fine with 3/5 aluminum interconnect design. It is 300 mm design fab that is going to cost $3-5B to construct and equipment, steppers, lithography technology has road blockage. If any goes wrong the plating equipment fire in March at a Renesas fab in Jpn used by GM and other car manufacturers can only make matters worse. It uses 300 mm technology.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Thank You for your professional input; it’s helpful. I believe Skywater Tech specializes in 200mm wafers and is approved/cleared for government projects. I made a few bucks on them but they missed earnings. It is your opinion the SKYT will benefit from increasing demand for 200mm wafers?,2,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"I'm unconvinced that the US will be able to successfully defend Taiwan from reunification with China.We all think it is ""unimaginable"", but to China, Taiwan is the gateway to the Pacific and is a crucial and necessary conquest. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.When? When the Chinese determine that their military capabilities sufficiently threaten any US Carrier group in the pacific. Currently there's a fierce debate if they've crossed that threshold yet or not.Generally speaking - Guam and Okinawa are regarded as completely gone in a war LIMITED WAR with China.Carrier groups are a little more difficult because of their obscurity by mobility. But, China has the weapons to entirely destroy US carrier battle groups.US will probably learn from its recent wargames, but it would be a tremendous mistake if the US aggregates forces together. The Chinese hyspersonic ship-killing missile capability is excellent and most of them are launched from the H-6 bomber fleet well within the safetynet of Chinese AA.TL;DR, Taiwan's future is very uncertain. Invest in it at your own risk.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecxiQ68CA5g&t=2052s",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Thank you for your contribution. Well written and to the point. I believe that the war on China is sought by more than US alone. If China had done a few things differently: 1. Developed their own patents rather than steal from US 2. Not forced upon its people, devastating work conditions which they have no choice but to subject themselves to 3. Move their Red Fence over and over again towards Taiwan… Then maybe the whole lot of the world wouldn’t be ready to strangle their pipeline. But we all are. We know what will happen if China is allowed to apply their dictatorship on the world. Not happening.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Well dictatorship aside. The West has no interest in allowing any Asian power to become a real global super power. It was inevitable that China will get hemmed in. Had the Chinese nationalists succeeded then all of China would be unified and thatd be a bigger problem. Instead we get to sort of use Taiwan against China.None of the alternatives are any good...a misstep will result in a power vacuum filled by bigger problems.Japan is pacifist, for now. But when a wolf tastes blood, it goes feral again. Now matter how hard you beat it down.And humans are like wolves, especially when new generations forget the struggles of their fathers",2,nan,nan,nan
