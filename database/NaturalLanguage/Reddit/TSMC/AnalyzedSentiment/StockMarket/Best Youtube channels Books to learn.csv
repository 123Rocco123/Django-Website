,"Good morning gentlemen, I started investing a year ago with a DCA on SP500, Gold ETF and TSMC and had really good results so far. But the market was really positive and i didn't really had to think a lot by myself. With current situations, i figured out that i Get scared by all news and panic selling videos, makes me realize that I should better understand how everything works. Would you have any advice on Books and Youtube Channel to educate myself on stock markets? It's difficult to know if a Youtube Channel is legit or just a Andrew Tate wannabe when you don't have the knowledge Thanks!",Your brokerage website likely has a good collection of lessons and information about investing. At least Fidelity does.,0,nan,nan,nan

It's 3 people plus a guest and all have different outlooks, one does fundamentals, one does technicals, the other does stories. They talk broad market and individual stocks, earning reports break down, fed info. Ideas for long and short term trades. It's not going to teach you how to set a oso trade but will give you what you need to know on how to think about trading and important considerations. Can't recommend it enough",0,nan,nan,nan

He does get a bit clickbaity, when there isn't much news. But When the market is moving his info is really good. He focuses on Tech stock mostly.Why do you have gold as an ETF? I don't hold gold anymore because it is a safety/hedge, it's not an investment (it won't shoot up 40% like other stocks. If it does that means we're in big trouble, like a war or something, and that's when you would want physical gold. PLus it's pretty so why not buy physical, if you like holding the ETF?wishing you luck, you got this",0,nan,nan,nan

Not that you would, but if you sold it back the same day the place would buy it at $2330usd.So basically the supplier makes $30-40USD on each ounce or around 1.7%, which is way lower than buying an ETF.Make sure you buy from a place that charges a low price above spot value. Some currency exchanges are good spots to buy from if they are a large brand (check their reviews for safety), banks generally charge a bit too much where I live, but you can check to see their rate, they will be one of the safer places to buy from.",2,nan,nan,nan
