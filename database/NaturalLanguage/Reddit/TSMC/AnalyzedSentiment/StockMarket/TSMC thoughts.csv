,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now. Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year? Is there a long term risk with china and competition with Intel and Samsung?","I have 4/19 , 200 but I'm still thinking of actually buying the stock.",0,nan,nan,nan

Once this leg tops out, I’d be tempted to take profits and sit on the sidelines. I bought AMAT at the same time and I’m up more.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year? Is there a long term risk with china and competition with Intel and Samsung?","Just so you are aware, the AZ fab will have a monthly output of about 30,000 12-inch equivalent wafers.Taiwan-based TSMC monthly output is about 2.2 million 12-inch equivalent wafers.",1,nan,nan,nan

So far not disappointed. I know the china variable doesn't bode well, but as long as they're still the main chip supplier for nvda (and I missed that boat), I'm un. :)",0,nan,nan,nan

The gains from an attack on Taiwan do not outweigh the risks to China; plus, the structure of the Chinese government allows it to achieve nearly all goals and gains from reunification without actually attacking Taiwan. It's sabre-rattling at its finest.",0,nan,nan,nan
