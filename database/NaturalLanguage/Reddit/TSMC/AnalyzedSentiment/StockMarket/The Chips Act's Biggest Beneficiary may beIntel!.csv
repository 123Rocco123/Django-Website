,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",Grandma proud,0,nan,nan,nan

Intel isn’t some golden goose that will shine in the darknessBoth Samsung and TSMC have both gotten tons of money in loans and grants for Fabs. Both of which do better than Intel. They are also building in other places around the world too while Intel has halted things.Intel has halted other chip plants around the world. Most that are continuing building are ones where an investment group is buying like a 50% stake in said fabs. Which isn’t good for long term profitability.Intel’s 13th gen and 14th gen chips just got an alleged fix to their microcode. Before this fix chips overtime were degrading and essentially bricking themselves. People and business are not happy. A lot of trust is gone because they handled this all the wrong way and some business lost millions.Going off of my last point they still need to sell the 13th and 14th gen cpu’s in their inventory. The trust is gone. No one unless Intel sells them for dirt cheap is going to buy them. This is going to have a lot of future consequences. CCG over the next two quarters might not look so good.Intel is currently getting their lunch money taken by AMD in Datacenter/AI chips. This isn’t going to change and could get much much worse. Intel currently has margins of 9% here. They are basically giving them away.A lot of companies are moving to Amd in Datacenter/Ai . Intel might have agreements and contracts but many of those will expire in the future.Intel has debt that’s growing and continues to grow. They have 20 billion of cash on hand and almost 52 billion in debt while the market cap is hovering in the 80-90 billion range. If this falls at all we will see banks calling.Intels investments like Mobileye for example have fallen quite a lot. It could have been used for an emergency piggy bank for them. At one point their stake was worth 25 billion now it’s worth 10 ish billion.Intel when announcing the job cuts also said they were cutting time off, vacation time people earned and benefits and quality of life things across the board to save money. Their stock is also bricking and shows no momentum.Why is the above point important ? Because Intel already has a talent problem that NOW has exponentially got worse. What is left of the talent is going to leave, or is getting to get cut in layoffs and new employees are going to be bottom of the barrel.Cutting 1/5 of the workforce isn’t a small thing. Do people really think this won’t affect their releases as well as engineering on chips going forward ?If Intel loses any support at all in CCG they will be in monster trouble. It’s the only big area of support they still have. The 13th and 14th gen scandal and their lack of leadership handling it is going to be trouble.They are probably going to be taken off the Dow shortly in place of Nvidia or AMD. Which will then cause funds to sell their positions.I don’t understand why anyone would buy Intel right now when their fabs they keep talking about keep getting delayed and probably won’t be working until late 2026 to mid 2027. Especially when in the short term they literally have nothing but negative press coming. Long term maybe it’s a buy but it’s not like they are going to go up for quite a while if they see the light at the end of the tunnel.",0,nan,nan,nan

For anyone that isn’t aware, the CHIPS act is mainly focused on onshoring fabs and foundries, so the main (indirect) beneficiaries will be semiconductor equipment manufacturers. That’s companies like ASML, AMAT, LRCX, Tokyo Electron, and Hitachi.",1,nan,nan,nan

Investing in secondary benefactors isn’t a bad thing and long term is probably a winning strategy.That being said I really think the 13th gen and 14th gen cpu fuck ups in the short term and long term are gonna hurt Intel a lot and really harm them. There’s so many domino effects here.Intel handled this in all the wrong ways. They called out motherboard manufacturers then realized it was their problem and flip flopped on warranties. And sort of tried to minimize the problem at the start of things.A lot of people who bought prebuilts or built their own PC are going to go to Amd next time if they weren’t alreadyPeople who haven’t bought a new cpu yet are gonna stay far away from 13th and 14th gen chips regardless if the code/issues are fixed.Business’s got really burnt by this too. I can’t imagine companies are happy at all. This will only accelerate people moving away from Intel to AMD or even Arm.Now the benefit is in mid October Intel likely releases new chips but I just can’t imagine it selling as well now that the trust is gone. They are still going to need to sell through their stock of 13th and 14th gen chips and I don’t know how they are going to do that. I genuinely don’t see people buying this CPU’s unless they are incredibly dirt cheap.The other issue that I have with Intel is the talent. Who’s going to want to work for basically the only company in the semiconductor space that is struggling where they could get laid off. A place where the benefits have been cut and the perks are garbage.I just don’t get it. Unless Intel had more fat than an arctic seal I don’t know how they are going to make deadlines when they are cutting like 1/5 of the workforce especially when part of the 1/5 is likely talent or experienced people. Maybe this means cutting a ton of products and focusing on a few but unless you blow your competitors out of the water it doesn’t do much.,2,nan,nan,nan

They have an advantage as one of the few US companies that still has fab expertise, so it would make sense for them to pivot from a field where they’ve stagnated for decades to one where they have a clear advantage. TBH that’s the only way I’d bet on intel moving forward.That said, I’m not sure how good their fab pipeline is. I know they aren’t able to make the most cutting edge chips (>=5 nm) because they lack the equipment, but that could (somewhat) easily be reconciled, especially with a government injection. The main question (and the crux of your last comment) is whether they have the talent pool on that end to be at the cutting edge of fabrication. How is their reliability, miss rate, scale? TSMC is where they are for a reason. Can Intel even compete on that front? If not, they’re basically dead in the water…",3,nan,nan,nan

I mean very specific teams or functions?What thinking thinking here is related to your last comment about a very different company. I’m wondering if they’re starting that process now, I.e., they’ve identified one strategic direction, 1 or 2 singular directives. If this is the case, then the entire mentality shifts. They’d look to reduce everything accept those to bare bones; businesses that can bring in cash with a skeleton crew, expecting attrition, which they can either shutter less expensively or perform an asset sale of whatever’s marketable. In parallel, they’re essentially resizing to a start up with the US government as their venture backer. This seems incredibly drastic as first pass, but less so after all of your points above. It would be a Herculean turnaround effort, however potentially the only thing that might save them.Do you know what their current segment sales/profits look like?I’m not super well versed in Intels P&L breakdown, so what I’m thinking about here is how, who, and what revenues they start targeting as not valuable enough. What revenues can they harvest, what do they keep, what’s “cheap” revenue/cash generating. The play here is two fold: who benefits from an asset sale, if we can predict what assets/ sectors they move out of? If we right size Intel per some of these thoughts what does that company look like? What do likely scenarios look like in terms of stock price? And if we squint hard enough, at that point, with a shitload of chips funding, do I like that buy point and vector?Two last thoughts related to CHIPS, do you know how CHIPs funding is operationally imparted to Intel?Thinking about how a buyer might be affected by the potential capitalization. And if that funding would be impacted by a chapter 11.Look forward to your thoughts!",5,nan,nan,nan

The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",The analysis regarding talent leaving and more importantly the lack of fabrication specialized talent here in the U.S is one of the major bottlenecks in the CHIPS act plan. We just don't have a pipeline of talent specialized for high end fabrication work that TSMC has going for them. My colleagues at TSMC are themselves concerned they will not be able to hire the people they need in the U.S. facilities they have are trying to get operational while some of my colleagues at Intel are also leaving the company so... that doesn't bode well for the success of the CHIPS act.,4,nan,nan,nan
,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area.

They are by far the biggest semiconductor manufacturer in the USA and their downfall *is* the reason chips act exists in the first place.I am not saying that supporting Intel is a good idea, what I am saying is if there is going to be an effort to onshore semiconductor manufacturing. It's only fair that Intel gets the biggest pie.Every other Intel business (for the most part) is profitable except manufacturing. If Intel actually span off their fabs and relied on TSMC like AMD did, they would most likely be profitable and if chips act didn't exist that is what would happen most likely.This would result in probably much larger job cuts, which probably explains government interest (Most of the jobs in Intel are for manufacturing.) So you can thank Chips act, as that is the reason why ""only"" 1/5 of the jobs in Intel were cut.Everything you told regarding the Intel chips are due to Intel trying to compete with inferior manufacturing. (10nm) They have to push their cpus so hard, because otherwise they can't compete and they use 10nm because that is the most advanced node they can produce in USA.I would go as far to say, if Intel rejected chips act and instead closed/sold off their western fabs back in the day, their market cap would have been higher today.One more thing to note is before the lay offs, Intel employed more people than AMD, NVIDIA, TSMC combined. Not only that every Intel employee is estimated to contribute 4 more jobs to where they live. So Intel going down would be a big problem on unemployment for USA.",1,nan,nan,nan

THE NEW high-na machines have kinks to work out so unless ASML and Intel can work closely to solve them, they are going to have a hard time getting newer nodes.

,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.

Intel needs to make some money moves and not undercut itself in order for them to succeed, alongside this government assistance.Also, how is the engineering workforce going to be seeing a shortage?

However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.","Yes, of course, but will the stock price go up?

Nvidia already dominate data centers - if they ever opt to make this move and do everything in house, then watch out. Given the disappearing globalization and geo-political issues around China/Taiwan and USA, I think the US govt is hoping for a chips powerhouse on their own turf.",0,nan,nan,nan
