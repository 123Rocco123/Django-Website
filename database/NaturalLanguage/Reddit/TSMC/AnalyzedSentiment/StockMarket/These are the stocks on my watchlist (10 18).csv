I've been holding QCOM for quite a while, I know they are a great quality company, therefore I expected a similar rise like the rest of semis. But I don't know it seems that for every step forward it takes, it takes 2 back.I don't know if it's the management, which so far do not seem to care about any bad rumor / press is released, or they straight up announce some bad news (like today). They do not seem to care at all about the share price, which to me seems like a double edge sword... Or the high institutional holding being a key role in the flatness.I'm quite confident on the support level at around the current price, however, I don't feel like it's achieving the potential momentum it could get...What are your tips on this cases? I'm starting to doubt myself...",0,nan,nan,nan
