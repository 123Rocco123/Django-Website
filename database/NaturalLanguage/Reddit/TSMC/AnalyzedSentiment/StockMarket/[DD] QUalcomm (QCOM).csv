Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.
