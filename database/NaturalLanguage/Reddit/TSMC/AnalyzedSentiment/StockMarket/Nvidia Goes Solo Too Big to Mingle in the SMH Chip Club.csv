,nan,"Nvidia's market cap alone is nearly as big as the combined market cap of the other 22 chip companies in the SMH ETF, missing the total by just $44.74 billion!",0,nan,nan,nan

,nan,AMD has a bigger market cap than INTC. Wow I never realized that,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,And AMD has crazy potential for growth üôå,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Sorry, I don't see it the same way you do, I see it like a subsidiary of nvda (it doesn't belong to any). As long as nvda exists AMD will have no potential. But I bought stock in their company lol",2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,It is amazing. I do not see things changing a lot anytime soon.There is going to be a huge shortage of AI computation resources for the next couple of years and likely going to get worse.One reason I did buy more Google is because they are now the third largest provider of datacenter chips and will to #2 in the next year. Will be only behind Nvidia.As more things like generative video and such come on line it should enable the companies with AI computational resources to do well.https://blog.svc.techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DCC-2405-806_Figure2.png,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Reality and stock price are 2 different things. You, every analyst that exists, and likely my neighbor's plumber's cat at this point are all saying the exact same thing, and thus we get Nvidia where it is today. At the very first sign that this growth could possible maybe potentially slow down, Nvidia is going to get cut in half.Just bear in mind a measly 2.5 years ago Elon was the richest person on earth and I'll be damned Tesla is never going to come down boys come on lets HODL cause we like the stock. Now take a look. Don't for a minute try to blame it on the twitter controversy either, every single bubble that has ever existed also had a pin to pop it",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Yep don't buy the hype.My team does gen AI and is the hype of the company. But I'm skeptical that it'll be the golden child every analyst out there is making it out to be.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Comparing Nvidia to an Elon company is dirty work. Jensen has shown none of the poor decision making and leadership that took Tesla down.,2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"You're doing that thing again. Comparing inflated stock prices to reality. Every bubble has a pin that pops it.Yes, as a general rule of thumb, the health of a company should be reflected in the stock price and vice versa. However, sometimes that just isn't the case. You're sounding like every investor that went broke during the .com bubble. This is the AI bubble.Nvidia isn't worth 5 times as much as Walmart, there's just no reality in which thas the case. Yet, Nvidia on paper currently is valued at exactly that.If you think that is accurate valuation and isn't pure speculation and hype then I really dont know what to tell you",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,You could try selling him some of those sweet gourds.,4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Walmarts profit and nvidias profit are 2 different things. Nvidia speculating profits are big hence the price. Ofcourse it‚Äôs a bubble which stock ain‚Äôt? But it going to split and hit 3t before coming down or even hit higher depending on like the man said above Jen seng making all the sweet and right decisions and he is focused on 1 thing unlike elon Tesla, failed boring company, space x, now twitter. And then he cries on twitter about how shit should be and charge arm and a leg for a car china making better with longer range for 1/4th of the price?",4,nan,nan,nan
