Why would you hold the 5th best company in a sector that you're also holding the market leader and second place?You're just scared and uneducated that you've purchased the wrong stocks so you have back up ones in case one of the other ones ends up doing better.Keep the best in every sector, get rid of the rest.

It already has since i started doing it, but that $50 just keeps going in and aggressively DCA'ing.As for stocks, i hold Google purely as a way to hold onto cash. It's not really a long term investment for me. When i get money, if Tesla and Nvidia are highly overvalued, i put it into Google until i need the cash for my main holdings.I am a photographer and graphic designer, so Adobe is my world on a day to day.

But my money was too thinly spead, and I was constantly tossing and turning and putting money into the 10th best investment I had, the 24th best one, the 31st best one... Just to keep buying dips and balancing portfolios and 'protecting myself' by being as diversified in my sector as I could.This heavily crippled my returns, because my vision was always the same, i just didn't have the guts to double down on the real winners that I wanted to own.Risk is different for everyone, and my portfolio is not riskier than yours or anyone elses. i wouldn't even call my portfolio risky.Risk is just a loose concept - to me, the risk of my portfolio not growing at a fast enough rate to keep up with global price increases is a far greater risk than me investing in high growth tech. The risk of me renting for the next 20 years vs. owning a home is much riskier for me than owning a home in the next 5-10.I'm a photographer and graphic designer who works for myself. I love that i do with a passion every day and I hope to never change that. My income is around $75k and it will likely go up but will also likely not go up significantly. So i have to weigh up my path to wealth, and it is using this concentrated strategy. Something 'safer' and more diversified is my idea of higher risk, based on my criteria and earning capability in life.Hope this gives perspective 🫶Honestly. If you're investing in good quality tech, you're already ahead of 99%, so I'm not worried about your portfolio at all. Just offering my perspective and sharing my 4-5 year journey and how this very portfolio approach (in a strong bull market) held me back.All the best!",3,nan,nan,nan

(OKLO) – 2%","If I had the answer I would be a retired billionaire.To some extent, we are all just making our most educated guess, with the information that we have and mindset that we believe strongest in.My strategy has remained the same since day one, But I would say that I have probably adjusted this strategy to some extent on an annual basis based on my portfolio's performance. I don't necessarily look at if a stock is going up or if a stock is going down. My main concern is a stock that is going sideways for an extended period of time. I would rather a stock go down than go sideways. High growth stocks. I meant to have volatility and either port heavily or sold heavily depending on the sentiment and the quarterly performance and the news that comes out.As long as my conviction in my primary stocks remains the same, I am quite unphased whether my stock goes up or down and how long it does this for. My investment strategy will remain the same.I started investing and had about four ETFs And built up to 30 individual stocks. I had roughly equal amounts of money in each of them... $500 to $1,000, And then had a couple more thousand in my favorites. Some did great, some did good, some did okay, some didn't do great, and some did really badly.It occurred to me that I was buying every stock that sounded like it had a good enough story for the next 10 years, And I looked at the chart for the last 10 years and saw that the growth was 1,000 plus percent, So I would be crazy not to have a slice of that pie...At the end of the day, I am realizing that the most important thing is that my money is invested into companies that I physically believe in, preferably am a daily user in, And is a company that I am prepared to watch, watch annual meetings of and read reports of without falling asleep.More recently though when I refined my stocks to just these four plus Bitcoin, I focused on creating an ecosystem where I am not only in high growth stocks, But that the success of one stock also positively impact the rest of my stocks.Electric cars, cryptocurrency miners require NVIDIAs services. Elon musk is a cryptocurrency supporter And I believe that there will be an integration of the two down the track. Trump loves Elon. Tesla brows exponentially when Nvidia launches new products that they can provide in order for him to get ahead... The vicious cycle goes on. They are all in the same ecosystem and feed each other.They ride together and die together.Many don't understand the full potential of these stocks and so they are highly overpriced in their eyes... When you only hold two or three stocks, You have the ability to dig so much deeper than if you hold 35.An example of this is a doctor who charges $20 for an appointment and can just about help you with everything whether you have an issue with your throat or your eye or your toe or your nose... He will give you generic advice and will charge accordingly. When your eye starts bleeding and you start losing vision... Are you going to go Doctor who charges you $20 and helped you with your toe and your nose? Or are you going to dig deep into your wallet and pay $500 for the eye specialist who has treated over 7,000 eyes that have been bleeding? I think you know the answer.The specialists have sacrificed a broad range of knowledge and instead have pursued excellence in a very narrow path. They can tell the symptoms that you have before you walk in the door and in their head. They have already got the solution to your problem as soon as you arrive without having to examine you.This is the level of expertise that I expect to hold of the stocks that are in my portfolio. If I'm holding 20 to 30 stocks (any more than) I cannot possibly expect to have the same level of understanding and commitment to each and every one of them. It is just not possible.To answer your question... In 2022 my portfolio went down about 40 or more percent.. I think my profits dropped a total of $60,000. Considering I only had about 40 to 45,000 in my portfolio of my own money, this is a pretty scary amount. My vision is clear and my timelines are clear, And I don't need a single cent that is in my investment portfolio until at least 2030 to 2035... So I held strong and decided that this was the perfect opportunity to refine my positions.Over those 12 months of heavy Tech correction, I think I sold over 20 stocks, some decent ones and some not so... Overall, I think I took a $23,000 loss. But this was the biggest gift I could have asked for, because I doubled down on my original vision, And made back that loss and at least $40,000 additional dollars in just months afterwards.My Tesla is up over 100% And my nvidia is close to 300%.There is always going to be an element of lock involved with investing, otherwise we would all be in mansions if they were pure facts that we could read about.I timed my execution beautifully and this was the only way to make enough money available to reinvest, So I followed my hot and went for it.In terms of my Google position, Don't get me wrong.... It is possibly the most stable and fantastic growth company that I can possibly think of. I am a little unclear of what Google will look like in the next 10 years as this new age arises, But I know they are going nowhere, And so I treat them like a high interest savings account. I put money into it, And whenever I need to take money out, I know that it will likely be a higher amount.I could very comfortably turn this into my primary position and have zero regrets, But my appetite for growth is a little bit higher than what this stock delivers, And so it is not the primary position for me. It is a very reliable position, But it is not at the top.Hopefully all of this information gives some insight and of course I'm always happy to talk more and elaborate if needed!I have used voice to text conversion for this post, as I am out walking before work.

I am in no hurry to purchase more stocks and I am in no hurry to cash out. It will go up and it will continue to go up, And that is what my position in Google is for. When the prices are less attractive, I am happy to strengthen my position in Google and help that money accumulate to a higher amount so that I can purchase my main two stocks when they are correcting.I have also recently been investing more aggressively into Bitcoin over the last 6 months, But I'm slowing down on that now as well. I can see the next 6 months. Probably being more focused around Google and letting the market settle a bit. Nvidia's growth is very much performance-based, Tesla's current growth is very much Trump based Rather than exceptional deliveries and quarterly performances...Having said that, I treat both positions as if they were ETFs. I am not a traitor and I will not sell. So any investments I make in the current day Will certainly be at a lower price than waiting 304 or 5 years for the perfect moment.
