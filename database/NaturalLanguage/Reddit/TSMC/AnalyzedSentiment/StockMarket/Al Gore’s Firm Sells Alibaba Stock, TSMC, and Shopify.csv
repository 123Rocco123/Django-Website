,nan,"The fund doesn’t appear to be performing well, and honestly I can’t figure out what they are even trying to accomplish.How does Schwab figure into saving the world? How does Equifax help the future? Henry Schein’s dental supplies?It doesn’t look like it is positioning for optimal returns nor sustainability…But I guess I don’t know what I expected. I guess I’d expect it to operate on a back room political favor basis (as that is why you’d pick a politician to manage a fund), rather than a bottom up or macro strategy…. So who knows?",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Seems pretty transparent to me. 1). Invest in ESG. 2). Use political allies to push and legislate ESG. 3). Make money. The only problem is that it seems enough investors are wise to the smoke show at this point.,1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Why did a man who spent so much time telling everyone that the end is near with climate change invest in Alibaba in the first place? The company consists in selling cheap crap in shipping containers all over the world. Is he a joke?,0,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"Oh I see what you mean. Nice technique by the way. I like pairing my vote with how the markets are influenced in a summary. It gives me less to complain about and I can afford to literally ignore the often times mind numbing political rhetoric. If my candidates of choice loses, my money wins by adding value to a practical business model. Thanks for sharing your style. I appreciate the cordial discussion. :)",6,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"China looks like its about to take over Taiwan and all Chinese stocks will most likely drop. TSMC will be dropping also if China takes over the country.

,nan,"So you believe that local temperatures equal climate change? Also, I thought it was changed from global warming to climate change in order to get fools to think that any cooling was also catastrophic. Your local temperature has nothing to do with global temperatures. Climate change is about 0.001 changes in GLOBAL temperatures. Educate yourself. Don’t give credence to anyone who tells you something to believe while they are making billions of dollars and gaining power over you by your acceptance of their narrative. Example: Almost ZERO plastic products are recycled. 99% are put into landfills. Your trusted government and environmental advocates ever tell you that?!?! Of course not. Again, ZERO plastics are recycled! All of your effort to put your plastic soda bottles into the recycling bin to make yourself feel righteous is bullshit. Educate yourself and for god’s sake, stop believing ANYTHING the government tells you. Good luck to you.",2,nan,nan,nan
