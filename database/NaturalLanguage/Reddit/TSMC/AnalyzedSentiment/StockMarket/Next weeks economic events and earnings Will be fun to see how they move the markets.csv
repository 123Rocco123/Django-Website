,nan,Are puts generally cheaper right now because prices are down? I've never bought options so I don't know when I'm going to lower income person so it was always big risk but now seems more likely to put will pay through the first of next year,1,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"At the beginning of a bear market, keep your DCA going into your long term (retirement) accounts. And if you feel comfortable do some trading as the volatility makes that potentially very profitable. Also if you have some cash or a bond stake be patient as there will be a time sometime late in the Bear market cycle that you can very profitably move that money into equities. However I expect that time is still a year or two away. I added a fair bit of energy 2 weeks ago when crude was at $75. That has been a great bounce. I also added a fair bit of SPY Puts 6 weeks ago. However it was the profit on those puts that bought me the energy stocks. So I am looking for another rally to reload on the puts.",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"The CPI number will obviously be incredibly interesting, you have to assume any reading but a negative (like a reading that isn't above the last CPI)one is going to pump the market right? An even or lower number will show that CPI is officially on a downward trend, and if the trend is confirmed, you'd have to imagine the FEDs tone will be much more subdued. Either stay on course or reduce.And if that's the case, the market will start fairly immediately pricing it in right? Signaling what could be the start of a real bottom?The CPI at the end of the year/start of 2023 q1 will really tell the tale of where we're going after holiday season. But the last thing we need is to go through another 80s of trying to stamp inflation, letting up, and having to basically double down on hikes because it heats back up again.Very interesting times for the markets",0,nan,nan,nan
