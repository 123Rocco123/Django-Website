,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering?

AMD, Alphabet, Tesla, and TSMC are the stocks that make the cut for me. Apple might be a better stock than those, especially AMD if AMD fails to produce as good, or better, AI chips than Nvidia like I think they will succeed in.It's a bit of a spectrum from pure gambling to perfectly informed decisions where it is a bit hard to tell where a decision becomes a calculated and well informed risk instead of gambling. I appreciate the warning that I am not sufficiently far towards perfect information on that axis.Why do you think Microsoft and Apple will outperform the market? I think it is likely for both too, but I want your reasons. Do you not see Alphabet and TSMC performing equally well? AMD depends on how their chips perform. How about Tesla?",3,nan,nan,nan
