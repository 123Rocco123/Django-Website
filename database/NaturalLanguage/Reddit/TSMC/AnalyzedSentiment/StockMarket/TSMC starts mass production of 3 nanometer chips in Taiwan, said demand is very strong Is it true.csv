,"Title explained most of the content in the news, TSMC started the mass production of 3 nanometer chips. TSMC chairman Mark Liu said the demand for these 3 nanometer chips are “very strong”, and its going to create end products with a market value of $1.5 trillion within 5 years. News source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tsmc-starts-volume-production-065856127.html Is this really a thing? TSMC’s major clients includes Apple and Nvidia, but looking at AAPL and NVDA’s revenues, the growth has decreased significantly. AAPL had double digits revenue growth last year, but for this year, it’s only single digit. AAPL revenue Things are similar in NVDA, revenue growth was double digits in the first quarter, but dropped to single digit even negative growth in the following quarters. NVDA revenue Considering that we are facing a global recession and 5G is not as hot as it was years ago, I really doubt demand for those products are going to be very strong. Personally, I haven’t got a new smartphone for four years. I am losing desire to buy myself a new smartphone because I see less new features on the iPhone, the only feature that the new smartphones attract me is the bigger storage.
