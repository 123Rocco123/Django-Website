,"The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%. The two industrial giants will announce earnings on Monday and Thursday before the market.",Good prioritization. Would have been helpful when mentioning Truss resignation to follow with a line about the new PM and what his economic direction will be.,0,nan,nan,nan
