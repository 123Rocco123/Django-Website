,nan,So TSMC is beating…itself? Good problem to have I guess lol.,0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,Diversifying away from China is always a good idea in this case especially but I think it’s still a very big IF. Letting China take control of 90+% of high end semiconductor manufacturing is just something that the world won’t allow to happen…the US isn’t the only economy that feels that way. Both TSMC and ASML can remotely disable and cripple their own machines rendering them useless in the event of an invasion. It’s their own version of a nuclear deterrent. Don’t think I have to state what doing something like that would do to the world’s trade and economic security. The Pandemic gave us a glimpse of just a fraction of the issues that would cause. Imagine a complete 100% shut down of the entire industry for potentially years. It would be beyond catastrophic.,1,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"Nope. Im bullish long term, but that doesn’t mean I don’t think we’re overheated and due for a correction in the short term.Besides, my comments were talking about the China Taiwan risk and how I don’t agree with it or think that China invading will happen, not whether I’m bearish on the US economy. I simply stated what would happen if that came to fruition and how incredibly bad it would be and why I think it won’t because of said reasons.",6,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"Yeah I didn’t either until someone mentioned it a long time ago when Buffett held a position in TSM and they were all talking about the China risk. You can even google it, CEO mentions it, ASML too.",3,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"yeah, the US isn't nuking anyone over Taiwan dude. And actually, that's not true. China's approach isn't to attack Taiwan. They are already putting party approved candidates in Taiwanese government, and they are putting mainland wealth and influence there. They'll do what the English did to the Scottish and just bugger them out.",6,nan,nan,nan
