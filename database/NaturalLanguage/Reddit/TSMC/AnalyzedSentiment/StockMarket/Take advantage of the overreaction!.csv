,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.","Best bet is to own INTC AMD and NVDA (as I do), and take advantage of dips like this to buy some calls on INTC. I bought $12 calls on AMD for .90 when it was at 9. Worked out pretty well. This feels like a good time for similar strategy with Intel.",0,nan,nan,nan

All you need to make money is for the price of the call to go up; all you need for that is for the price of underlying stock to go up (intc shares), which it probably will at some point in next few months. For example, see the trade I suggested (jan 21 $60 calls; you can buy them for $1 each, controlling 100 shares, so costing $100. If INTC goes up in next 3- 4 months, even by a few dollars, you could easily double your money or much more if it rallies on any good news or next earnings. The idea isnt to hold until expiration, but to make a profit and sell. In the shorter term, i feel like that's a good way to play intel. Longer term of course just buy the stock and add on dips. It's a good company still).In general, options are riskier and shouldn't be fooled with unless you understand them, and yes, you should be able to absorb an occasional total loss.",2,nan,nan,nan

For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny.

I sold a couple days ago, dumped for more AMD, and that’s worked out really well.There’s a few things that caused me to do this.AMD still hasn’t announced their new CPU or even GPU lineup this fall. They’ve said “Zen 3 is coming” etc, but they really haven’t said much else. Just look what happened when they announced their latest chips, that’s what like 5% of their overall sales potential? If that???Intel just released a new line of processors. They are fresh and are barely competing with AMD’s latest line, Zen 2. Fact of the matter, intel is holding on to their fan base for the time being, but soon, AMD is going to take that over. Intel will have NO option but to lower their price, which will lower their value even more.AMD is projected to receive between 30% and 50% of market share in certain fields within the next 2-3 years. They’re currently at 5%. To put that in perspective, Intel will just be spitting out 7nm processors when AMD is on Zen5.AMD is supplying XBOX and PS5 with their two most expensive components; even at a measly $300 for those combos, which could be undervalued, and estimated 100 million consoles sold over the next 3 years on the light side, is 30 billion dollars. Almost a third of their total value right now. There’s no way this is priced in yet.Just by using some basic math, one could tell that AMD has so much further to go and Intel isn’t looking bright for the next couple of years. AMD hands down is the better purchase. Buy Intel after AMD has the dominant market and they’ll come storming back",0,nan,nan,nan

Being a vertically integrated chip company for so long, its net margins are also like 8x AMD. Say something happens that shocks chip demand, Intel will be the much safer bet. When they switch over their manufacturing to TSMC, their margins may drop but for the current sub 10 PE ratio, the stock price can more than handle it. Lastly, motherboard designs take decades to infiltrate into mainstream server applications. While the Epyc lineup is making headlines right now, those are expensive, low unit # low margin sales to high end customers.

While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

It certainly is something that can be fixed in 6-7 month, but on the scale of chip manufacturing, this 6-7 month hiccup effectively translate a weakness that will have intel play catch up for the next 5+ years, and that’s assuming intel execute flawlessly without any more hiccup.It might not even be worth it for them to continue this part of their business, and may lead them to become fab-less chip company.",0,nan,nan,nan

There server cpus 4x more expensive,than amd, there is no area of hardware intel has reason to be bought..nothing.. They dont have almost no products that compete in the market an the few that they have is 2x price.. The x64 the cpu we use today has its days counted,arm cpu like apple latest is the future,google it.. We have got to end of x64, and even amd has its days counted if they dont adapt also..an last investor call she said she wssnt going arm way..sticking to x64 thats something i thought was shortsighted..Amazom designing there own arm data cpu,not even amd they gunna use,everyone designing there own cpu..

Intel chose this route as opposed to EUV, which TSMC chose (incidentally, Intel are trying to use EUV on their own 7nm, which should show you which decision was right). The structure of quad patterning means that it is inherently prone to lower yields. When you combine this with the monolithic structure of Intel's CPUs, it will be impossible for them to produce high core-count chips (i.e. server/TOTL desktop) in any volume with the margins that they've seen historically. No amount of +++++++ will change this fact. I said two years ago that 10nm would be a complete writeoff and I stand by that today.Your point about IP is very valid. In my models I forecast that AMD will have very little share in the datacentre GPUs (but AMD has their own raytracing implementation coming out with the new consoles; which imo will be more efficient than Nvidia's due to Microsoft writing DXR with AMD's hardware in mind), but their IP helps out massively in the CPU arena. It'll be very difficult for Intel to build a competitor to chiplets without infringing on patents - which is the only way 10nm could be viable.As for taking people at face value:https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017Intel have announced delays to 10nm by 'a year' for every year since 2016. I don't see anything that would suggest 7nm is anything different.https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporaryTSMC views Intel and AMD completely differently. It's very much in their favour to help AMD out as much as possible with wafer supply, and limit Intel's own production. AMD's long term success ensures growth for TSMC; while Intel's long term success would mean they reclaim the process crown and constrict TSMC's market share.I agree that AMD is highly priced right now - they're above my valuation for the first time ever, while Intel is slightly underpriced. However, in the past few years AMD have consistently executed on their roadmaps, increasing their value while Intel has constantly screwed up, decreasing theirs. It's very possible that you buy into Intel now, while its' price> value, but then value decreases as they continue to fail and your price is never realised.TLDR: The big picture is that 10nm is a total writeoff, and 7nm is looking pretty shoddy as well. They bit off more than they could chew trying to get GaaFets to work. Intel's dominance and past price has been built on its process lead, and losing that lead and having to go to TSMC who will treat them poorly justifies a large drop in price. You have to make the decision as to whether you view the drop as justified or not.",0,nan,nan,nan

So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.","Y’all know Intel may be a little lower than it should, but TSMC has said that they won’t be making room for Intel, which will either drive AMD, Intel, and TSMC up or Intel down further?",0,nan,nan,nan

Overpriced in todays market when there are similar preforming processors for cheaper. Intel need to have a more competitive priced range of products to win back market share.",0,nan,nan,nan
