nan,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
nan,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

nan,"Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics. Is it only me that I am thinkin an armagedon will surely come or I am just saying nonsense. In this situation I am speculating about an hypothetical opportunity of mid-term investment that could take place from 2023 to 2030. As a 20 year-old non experienced investor i would love to read all your opinions.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,1.0
nan,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

nan,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

nan,"Anybody else have any DD on intel? Other than the $20 billion they’re putting into two more fab facilities? I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here. Given everything, and my own speculation, I’m thinking about getting a one way ticket and seeing where it takes me. Any one else thinking of joining?",0.5215,NEGATIVE,0.9944
nan,"I’m a believer in the long term health of this amazing company headed by a great CEO! I’m wondering if it has anything to do with Modi’s visit to Russia and the looming Taiwan threat, as it relates to TSMC. Or maybe they’ve figured out that intel will have the most advanced manufacturing capacity in place for the next several years, after having locked out TSMC on the latest lithography (ASML) machines.

nan,"Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
nan,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

nan,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
nan,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

nan,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing. Customers will run first to mass-producing cutting-edge technology first. Which of the two will win.

nan,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

nan,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

nan,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

TSM manufactures these chips, and is one of the few companies with the strongest moat in the entire semiconductor supply chain. Think of TSM as literally the 1 Jenga block that supports the entire tower. Supply Chain Overview: TSMC is a major player in the entire manufacturing process.

Why does TSM have a moat in manufacturing semiconductors? Answer: High Barriers to Entry Manufacturing Knowledge & Quality Assurance Costly PPE to setup plants. Costly/Custom Automation within Semiconductor Plants High Switchover Costs with existing Customers.

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight. In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is 25% less than last year. The grounding of the Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt & Whitney engines following the failure of an engine on a plane over Colorado has further exacerbated capacity constraints.

nan,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

nan,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

nan,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics. Is it only me that I am thinkin an armagedon will surely come or I am just saying nonsense. In this situation I am speculating about an hypothetical opportunity of mid-term investment that could take place from 2023 to 2030.

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok.

Future of Semiconductor market.csv,"I bought some Stellantis stock last week. With production and markets spanning the globe and with a heavy focus on EV's I can see them increasing their valuation as already the 4th largest automaker. The auto industry was hit with a massive chip shortage and TSMC stepped in. With such a large dependence on one countries production, and one that has a tenuous relationship and proximity to China. It seems like a western Semiconductor producer would be very worthwhile.

INTC DD.csv,"Anybody else have any DD on intel? Other than the $20 billion they’re putting into two more fab facilities? I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here. Given everything, and my own speculation, I’m thinking about getting a one way ticket and seeing where it takes me. Any one else thinking of joining?",0.5215,NEGATIVE,0.9944

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed.

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics.

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk. I just like to write about stuff like this on my site.",0.5391,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here.

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued.

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.

Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight. In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is 25% less than last year. The grounding of the Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt & Whitney engines following the failure of an engine on a plane over Colorado has further exacerbated capacity constraints.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

These ETFs have shares of AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx, NXP, Microchip, Texas Instruments, Maxim Integrated, ASML, TSMC, qorvo, STMicroeletronics... Will my only solution be to create a pie on the T212 broker similar to these ETFs and invest there? I don't like the T212 very much because they are still very amateur and don't support several important features like merges. For example, if I acquire shares of AMD and Xilinx and AMD's acquisition of Xilinx goes through, they won't be able to merge and sell as my shares of Xilinx without telling me like how it happened to several people holding shares in Tilray and Apharia.",0.5313,POSITIVE,0.5794

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ?

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why.csv,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges. Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years? Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference: CEO Predecessor's Reason for Departure Public Criticism or Perceived Failures Successor’s Key Attributes Pat Gelsinger Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware Bob Swan Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen Brian Krzanich Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider Paul Otellini Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus Craig Barrett Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise Questions to consider: What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?

INTC DD.csv,"Anybody else have any DD on intel? Other than the $20 billion they’re putting into two more fab facilities? I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here. Given everything, and my own speculation, I’m thinking about getting a one way ticket and seeing where it takes me. Any one else thinking of joining?",0.5215,NEGATIVE,0.9944

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443
IS TSM A STRONG BUY.csv,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals. So, are semiconductors companies good long term investments?

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995
TDG vs Major Exchanges for Buy & Hold.csv,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now.

This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999
US China Semiconductor Restrictions Hit Chinese Startup and NVIDIA competitor Biren Technology.csv,"TSMC Suspends Production of Advanced Silicon for Chinese startup Biren Technology to Ensure Compliance with US Regulations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The decision is connected with information in the public domain that Biren’s products outperform Nvidia Corp.’s A100 chips, which are now banned for the Chinese market, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. While TSMC has not reached a conclusion on whether Biren’s products meet the US threshold for restrictions, the Taiwanese chipmaker has decided to stop supplies to the Chinese startup for now, the person said. Biren was seeking new funds earlier this year at a valuation of $2.7 billion, Bloomberg News reported.

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment.

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why.csv,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges. Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years? Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference: CEO Predecessor's Reason for Departure Public Criticism or Perceived Failures Successor’s Key Attributes Pat Gelsinger Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware Bob Swan Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen Brian Krzanich Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider Paul Otellini Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus Craig Barrett Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise Questions to consider: What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?

TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here.

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443
IS TSM A STRONG BUY.csv,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals. So, are semiconductors companies good long term investments?

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left.

Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995
TDG vs Major Exchanges for Buy & Hold.csv,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Why does TSM have a moat in manufacturing semiconductors? Answer: High Barriers to Entry Manufacturing Knowledge & Quality Assurance Costly PPE to setup plants.

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight. In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is 25% less than last year. The grounding of the Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt & Whitney engines following the failure of an engine on a plane over Colorado has further exacerbated capacity constraints.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

"TSMC starts mass production of 3 nanometer chips in Taiwan, said demand is very strong Is it true.csv","Title explained most of the content in the news, TSMC started the mass production of 3 nanometer chips. TSMC chairman Mark Liu said the demand for these 3 nanometer chips are “very strong”, and its going to create end products with a market value of $1.5 trillion within 5 years. News source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tsmc-starts-volume-production-065856127.html Is this really a thing? TSMC’s major clients includes Apple and Nvidia, but looking at AAPL and NVDA’s revenues, the growth has decreased significantly. AAPL had double digits revenue growth last year, but for this year, it’s only single digit. AAPL revenue Things are similar in NVDA, revenue growth was double digits in the first quarter, but dropped to single digit even negative growth in the following quarters. NVDA revenue Considering that we are facing a global recession and 5G is not as hot as it was years ago, I really doubt demand for those products are going to be very strong. Personally, I haven’t got a new smartphone for four years. I am losing desire to buy myself a new smartphone because I see less new features on the iPhone, the only feature that the new smartphones attract me is the bigger storage.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999
US China Semiconductor Restrictions Hit Chinese Startup and NVIDIA competitor Biren Technology.csv,"TSMC Suspends Production of Advanced Silicon for Chinese startup Biren Technology to Ensure Compliance with US Regulations, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment.

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics. Is it only me that I am thinkin an armagedon will surely come or I am just saying nonsense. In this situation I am speculating about an hypothetical opportunity of mid-term investment that could take place from 2023 to 2030. As a 20 year-old non experienced investor i would love to read all your opinions.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,1.0
Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443
IS TSM A STRONG BUY.csv,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued.

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995
TDG vs Major Exchanges for Buy & Hold.csv,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics.

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here. Given everything, and my own speculation, I’m thinking about getting a one way ticket and seeing where it takes me. Any one else thinking of joining?",0.5215,NEGATIVE,0.9944

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995

Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight. In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is 25% less than last year.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics.

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk. I just like to write about stuff like this on my site.",0.5391,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here.

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued.

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.

Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight. In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is 25% less than last year. The grounding of the Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt & Whitney engines following the failure of an engine on a plane over Colorado has further exacerbated capacity constraints.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

These ETFs have shares of AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx, NXP, Microchip, Texas Instruments, Maxim Integrated, ASML, TSMC, qorvo, STMicroeletronics... Will my only solution be to create a pie on the T212 broker similar to these ETFs and invest there? I don't like the T212 very much because they are still very amateur and don't support several important features like merges. For example, if I acquire shares of AMD and Xilinx and AMD's acquisition of Xilinx goes through, they won't be able to merge and sell as my shares of Xilinx without telling me like how it happened to several people holding shares in Tilray and Apharia.",0.5313,POSITIVE,0.5794

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why. And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",0.5594,NEGATIVE,1.0

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ?

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why.csv,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges. Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years? Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference: CEO Predecessor's Reason for Departure Public Criticism or Perceived Failures Successor’s Key Attributes Pat Gelsinger Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware Bob Swan Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen Brian Krzanich Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider Paul Otellini Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus Craig Barrett Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise Questions to consider: What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?

INTC DD.csv,"Anybody else have any DD on intel? Other than the $20 billion they’re putting into two more fab facilities? I have some very small potatoes with them and I’m debating whether or not to grow some more with them, or look elsewhere. I know Intel’s been around for years and years and fundamentally they seem pretty sound (hence why they’ve been around for so long), plus I know their CEO isn’t too fond of all the comments saying that intel is “no longer competitive” in today’s market. TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here. Given everything, and my own speculation, I’m thinking about getting a one way ticket and seeing where it takes me. Any one else thinking of joining?",0.5215,NEGATIVE,0.9944

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443
IS TSM A STRONG BUY.csv,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals. So, are semiconductors companies good long term investments?

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995
TDG vs Major Exchanges for Buy & Hold.csv,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now.

This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999
US China Semiconductor Restrictions Hit Chinese Startup and NVIDIA competitor Biren Technology.csv,"TSMC Suspends Production of Advanced Silicon for Chinese startup Biren Technology to Ensure Compliance with US Regulations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The decision is connected with information in the public domain that Biren’s products outperform Nvidia Corp.’s A100 chips, which are now banned for the Chinese market, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. While TSMC has not reached a conclusion on whether Biren’s products meet the US threshold for restrictions, the Taiwanese chipmaker has decided to stop supplies to the Chinese startup for now, the person said. Biren was seeking new funds earlier this year at a valuation of $2.7 billion, Bloomberg News reported.

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment.

Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why.csv,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges. Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years? Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference: CEO Predecessor's Reason for Departure Public Criticism or Perceived Failures Successor’s Key Attributes Pat Gelsinger Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware Bob Swan Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen Brian Krzanich Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider Paul Otellini Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus Craig Barrett Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise Questions to consider: What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?

TSMC has been giving them a little run for their money, but at the same time they’re partnered with them so I guess they can only do so much damage if they wanted too. The whole semiconductor and tech industry has been acting all funny recently, but I don’t think the only reason why is because of the shortage. Yea it’s increasing demand while simultaneously hindering supply, but I think there’s something deeper to it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m still another retard on here.

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443
IS TSM A STRONG BUY.csv,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals. So, are semiconductors companies good long term investments?

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left.

Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995
TDG vs Major Exchanges for Buy & Hold.csv,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

Why does TSM have a moat in manufacturing semiconductors? Answer: High Barriers to Entry Manufacturing Knowledge & Quality Assurance Costly PPE to setup plants.

Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight. In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is 25% less than last year. The grounding of the Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt & Whitney engines following the failure of an engine on a plane over Colorado has further exacerbated capacity constraints.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

"TSMC starts mass production of 3 nanometer chips in Taiwan, said demand is very strong Is it true.csv","Title explained most of the content in the news, TSMC started the mass production of 3 nanometer chips. TSMC chairman Mark Liu said the demand for these 3 nanometer chips are “very strong”, and its going to create end products with a market value of $1.5 trillion within 5 years. News source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tsmc-starts-volume-production-065856127.html Is this really a thing? TSMC’s major clients includes Apple and Nvidia, but looking at AAPL and NVDA’s revenues, the growth has decreased significantly. AAPL had double digits revenue growth last year, but for this year, it’s only single digit. AAPL revenue Things are similar in NVDA, revenue growth was double digits in the first quarter, but dropped to single digit even negative growth in the following quarters. NVDA revenue Considering that we are facing a global recession and 5G is not as hot as it was years ago, I really doubt demand for those products are going to be very strong. Personally, I haven’t got a new smartphone for four years. I am losing desire to buy myself a new smartphone because I see less new features on the iPhone, the only feature that the new smartphones attract me is the bigger storage.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999
US China Semiconductor Restrictions Hit Chinese Startup and NVIDIA competitor Biren Technology.csv,"TSMC Suspends Production of Advanced Silicon for Chinese startup Biren Technology to Ensure Compliance with US Regulations, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro A New Chapter in Mobile Technology.csv,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market. The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology. Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH). This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications. One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models. Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality. Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users. Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging. The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20. Market Impact and Strategic Implications The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei. The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs. Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts. However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade. The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices. While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base. Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware. Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology. Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro. The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue. Challenges and Competitive Landscape Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors. This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.",0.5358,POSITIVE,0.9996
Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023).csv,"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong. I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term. IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more. Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this): Nvidia I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks. 2. TSMC The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B. What I don't think are great for investment: Google/Alphabet Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS. 2. Tesla I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment.

"China will certainly invade Taiwan before 2030, what will happen to TSCM .csv","Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics. Is it only me that I am thinkin an armagedon will surely come or I am just saying nonsense. In this situation I am speculating about an hypothetical opportunity of mid-term investment that could take place from 2023 to 2030. As a 20 year-old non experienced investor i would love to read all your opinions.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,1.0
Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems.csv,"Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future. Lithography techniques Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [1]. Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling[2]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.[3] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. [4] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice… Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together) The problems with 10nm Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. [5] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure. When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. (Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here) Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build. Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view. When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture [6], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28, will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm [7] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.[8] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken. 7nm and beyond So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.[9] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays). The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. [10] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. [11] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. [12] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is. Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be found. As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. Conclusion I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

Do you believe in the Metaverse (FB) (MVRS).csv,"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to Meta (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all? What is the metaverse? The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand. The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept. Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data. But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider. What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack. Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram & WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company. I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social. This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet. Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine & Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, the opinions expressed in this post are entirely my own – always invest at your own risk.

"Intel Stock Evaluation + AMD Benchmark Price Target Rage, deep analysis.csv","Hey Reddit! Last week I asked Redditors to give me a stock and its main competitor, so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver! Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious! P.S. at the bottom you will find some pics of the financial modelling. TL:DR INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36 AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120 The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung. Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings. Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used. With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment. Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Background Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation. Purpose The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy. Methodology Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods: Discounted Free Cash Flow Graham's Fair Value Graham's Number Industry Outlook Overview The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022. Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects: Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain. Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management. Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others. Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability. In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient. It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more. The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions. Main Competitors Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM): Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs. Samsung Electronics (005930): Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors. These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC. Conclusions Disclaimer We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research. The Future Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years. Conclusions INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.",0.5479,NEGATIVE,0.7043
INTEL vs AMD vs NVIDIA - Looking for a Chip Stock which one should I buy.csv,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.

Investment plan for about 85 000 USD over the coming year.csv,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done)-Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered Nvidia (FOMO)-Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9855
Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443
IS TSM A STRONG BUY.csv,"TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making 13 million units a year for the likes of Apple and NVIDIA. It's not only Taiwan's biggest company, it's now the largest stock in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger even than China's Alibaba and Tencent. South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production. The global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued.

"Market Weekly Recap Streaming, Chips, Airline Stocks Led the Gain, Tesla Earnings Alarmed the Tech.csv","The major US indices jumped last week, with Dow Jones, S&P 500 index up nearly 5%, and Nasdaq rising 5.22%. Most sectors closed higher. Software, industrial, airline/cruise, and banking sectors were main winners. From macro perspective, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation last week, representing her massive tax cut plan ended, easing the possibility of a further elevation of UK’s inflation and global financial system’s chaos. Also, several Federal Reserve officials delivered hawkish speeches, pushing US10Y once rose above 4.2%, the highest level in 14 years. However, Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that, Fed will probably slow the pace of interest rate hikes in December to keep the economy from sinking into a recession, which pushes stocks higher. The possibility of 75+50 bps rate-hike in November and December meetings rose to 44% now, according to FedWatch. More US-listed companies released their third-quarter earnings last week, and overall results were better than expectations so far, giving investors a boost. These include and are not limited to: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (Banking sector), Netflix (Streaming services), ASML, Lam Research (Semiconductor), AT&T (Communications), Lockheed Martin (Defense). However, some results were disappointing, for example, Tesla (EV), Snap (Social Media), Abbott Laboratories (Healthcare), and Verizon Communications. FAAMG, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Caterpillar and Intel will announce their earnings reports this week, which will play a key role in the performance of stock market. FAAMG all closed higher, Amazon rose more than 11%, Alphabet, Meta slightly underperformed the market Amazon rose more than 11% last week, leading FAAMG, followed by Apple (6.42%) and Microsoft (5.93%), while the two major online advertisers Alphabet (4.73%) and Meta (2.56%) slightly underperformed the Nasdaq composite index. Lower yield is favorable for tech valuation, especially for cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft. Investors are also curious under macro headwinds, whether the demand for cloud services remains firm, which will be the main focus for their earnings. Amazon's stock price is now back to its April 2020's low, investors are closely watching the profitability of its e-commerce segment improve or deteriorate further under higher inflation, after the company implemented some cost-reduction initiatives. Social media giant Snap released disappointing Q3 earnings last week, which dragged down Alphabet and Meta’s stock performance. Although Snapchat DAU grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million in Q3, the company revenue grew only 6% Y/Y to $1.13 billion, the rate fell to single digit first time since its IPO in 2007; net loss expanded to $360 million, a 400% year-over-year due to restructuring expenses. The company did not provide outlook for the fourth quarter again, citing “ uncertainties related to the operating environment. It is highly likely that year-over-year revenue growth will decelerate over the rest of the fourth quarter.” The stock slumped more than 22% last week. Online advertising contributed most revenue for Alphabet and Meta, and Snap’s bad earnings have dampened investor confidence. Goldman Sachs, however, points out that Snap's revenue volatility is attributable to platform-specific headwinds, not an industry-wide problem. With higher inflation, companies are often the first to cut back on advertising spending, thus investors remain cautious about Meta and Alphabet’s earnings. Tesla gained 4.6% last week. Although the revenue for Q3 reached $21.45 billion, up 56% year-on-year, that’s lower than the expected $22.09 billion and missed expectations for the first time in a year; gross margin for the automotive was 27.9%, lower than the expected 28.4%; net income attributable to shareholders was $3.3 billion, up 103% year-on-year and higher than the expected $3.2 billion. Musk said deliveries will reach record levels in the fourth quarter and the long-term annual growth rate remains at 50%; Tesla is working on a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. Still, investors did not buy it, and the stock plunged 6.65% a day after the earnings out. Netflix jumped after adding 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 Netflix rose more than 25% last week thanks to a surprisingly good Q3 report. The revenue up 5.9% year-over-year to $7.926 billion, beating estimates of $7.837 billion, and net income down 3.5% to $1.398 billion. The streaming giant said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast. The company sees another 4.5 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter. “After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth,” the company said Tuesday. “The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.” Thanks to Netflix’s encouraging earnings, Disney also rose nearly 9% last week. ASML and Lam Research's stunning earnings helped chip stocks rally ASML and Lam Research, two major chip equipment manufacturers, rose 21.92% and 17.25% respectively last week, leading the semiconductor sector. In addition, Nvidia rose more than 11%, Broadcom, AMD rose more than 8%, Texas Instruments rose 7.67%, TSMC was down slightly by 0.27%. The world most advanced lithography maker ASML reported earnings last week, net revenue reached €5.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €5.39 billion; gross margin of 51.8%; net income was €1.7 billion, down 2.24% year-on-year, exceeding expectations of €1.42 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter net revenue of €6.1-6.6 billion, a further growth q/q, beating expectations of €6.13 billion. Net bookings for the third quarter reached a record €8.9 billion, implying continued strong demand for high-end lithography from chip majors under the macro + consumer electronics market uncertainties. Lam Research also reported better-than-expected earnings last week, revenue reached $5.07 billion, up 17.9% Y/Y, higher than the expected $4.92 billion; gross margin was 46%; net profit was $1.43 billion, up 21% year-on-year. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter around $5.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year. ""Solid execution combined with easing supply chain conditions produced strong overall performance,"" Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a news release. ""While we expect weaker wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2023, our technology leadership and demonstrated track record of managing through downturns provide us a strong foundation to capture the exciting opportunities ahead for the semiconductor industry."" Airline/ cruise, industrial, oil and gas sectors continue to outperform the broad market Although technology stocks face more uncertainty, consumers are particularly keen on necessities and travel at the moment. After Biden's announcement to release 15 million barrels of reserve oil last week, oil prices, and oil & gas stocks moved even higher. Specifically, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum jumped more than 6% last week, with Chevron rising more than 8%. It is estimated that the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels of oil per day. The amount does not even satisfy a day’s demand, but further decreases the inventory. In addition, many airline stocks have posted their Q3 results. With consumers' strong willingness to travel, combined with higher airfares, the airline’s quarterly revenue has exceeded the pre-epidemic level, while capacity is expected to be fully recovered next year, which boosted investor confidence. Boeing rose more than 6% last week, Delta, American Airlines rose more than 4%, and United Airlines rose more than 14%; while Carnival Cruise, Norwegian Cruise, and Royal Caribbean Cruises were all up more than 10% last week Industrial stocks also performed well last week, with Caterpillar rising 6.75% and General Electric rising 7.75%.

Samsung Electronics' EUV preparation is less than TSMC's.csv,"Samsung's goal is to become the #1 system semiconductor by 2030. I'm not sure if it's actually possible. TSMC seems to be a company that works well after 9 years. But looking differently, there are nine years left. In the meantime, technology will continue to develop remarkably, so the process now, the capacity now, will not have much meaning after 9 years. Rather than the next-generation exposure machine that will be released around 2028, the specifications are too different from EXE:5000, the next-generation High-NA exposure machine right now. It's still in the development stage, so many problems will have to be solved, and it won't be coming out on time. For a while, TSMC, which has a lot of 3400Cs, may overwhelm Samsung in terms of capacity. However, Samsung is not trying to beat TSMC right now anyway. If you harden your skills and secure enough next-generation equipment, the possibility of a reversal is open. It all depends on how well Samsung and TSMC are doing.

SiliconMotion of the Ocean - Mega Memory Upside Round 2 (SIMO).csv,"I'm posting this before SIMO gets away from everyone as its recovering faster than I'd hoped. I will continue updating. ""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist KEY POINTS SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy Wave of Upcoming Catalysts Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside) Sections Company Description Thesis Current Valuation & Financials Technicals & Market Mechanics Upcoming Catalysts Appendix Company Description Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues. Thesis SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations. This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4! I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis: This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering). What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good. More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no. In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185. Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace. Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3 My post from November 2021: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/ Current Valuation & Financials Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22 Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value. Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22 These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth. This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP [in PCIe Gen 5] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs. Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed. EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22 You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product) Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22 Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept! Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21 Analyst Price Target: $110 Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120. Technicals & Market Mechanics SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

Take advantage of the overreaction!.csv,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend. While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny. TLDR: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",0.5642,NEGATIVE,0.9995
TDG vs Major Exchanges for Buy & Hold.csv,"Hi all, I've read multiple posts on the pros and cons between a share trading on TDG, and it's sibling trading on NYS, NDQ, XET, FTS, etc. One of the things that was mentioned fairly often is the big difference in Volume. Am I correct or at least warm in thinking the following: An exchange with a huge volume of that share, is mostly beneficial for day or short-term traders? Since the volume will make more impact and makes it easily visible of what the stock is doing. However, for long/very long timeframes, buy and hold, think of five to 10 years spans, the volume is not really an important metric to keep in mind. How close am I about this? Or completely off? Example: ADR on TSMC at NYSE is $149 with 1,1 million volume ADR on TSMC at TDG is €139 with 26 thousand volume Not entirely sure what the $ > € conversion rate is in terms of my account costs, but as a buy and hold person, am I right that I don't have any benefits of buying it at NYSE?

The Chips Act's Biggest Beneficiary may beIntel!.csv,"The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead. 1.  The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today. 2.  Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles. 3.  The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032. The immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus. 4.  Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington. 5.  Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's ""trump card"" in ensuring U.S. protection. 6.  The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories. For individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",0.5285,NEGATIVE,0.955

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

News source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tsmc-starts-volume-production-065856127.html Is this really a thing?

AAPL revenue Things are similar in NVDA, revenue growth was double digits in the first quarter, but dropped to single digit even negative growth in the following quarters.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play.csv,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.5386,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future.  Conclusion We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.
