,"Some experts say the inavde will certainly take place before the 100th anniversary of the creation of the communist chinese party, so it is one of the biggest objectives of Xi to make ""consolidate the chinese population"". So that, Taiwan and the TSMC (n. 1 producer of semiconductors and electronic chips in the world, it satisfies the 90% of world demand ) will have HUGE problems. I know TSCM is already preparing for this, building new factories in USA and some other competitors like Intel are also doing the same thing. However, if it is quite clear that the conflict between China-Taiwan will probably go to worse, and so the supply of semiconductors and electronic chips will get FKED. Why no one is talking about investing in the big semiconductor european and american producers that will satisfy that demand in that scenario, like GLOBAL FOUNDRIES for example ? If the worst case scenario happens ( China invading Taiwan ), all big Tech companies will suffer astronomical losses, as well as other sectors like the automobilistic one. We are talking about a recession bigger than the actual one. Of course we dont even have to mention the already actual problems that we re having because of those supply probelms: business like Ford are having more than 40k semi-finished cars beeing parked ouside their fabrics.

The whole island.China gets nothing from it. China goes into stone age and shit goes down domestically for them. They won’t be able to feed their population. What does Xi and co have to gain from it? To get an uninhabitable island?Sure, world would sunk in a bad bad recession, but it would be nowhere as bad as for China.Xi is a dictator, but not as dumb as Putin.How about Kim? He is talking about nuking american imperialists every few days, he’s certainly invading US by 2030.",0,nan,nan,nan

Lo and behold I wake up one morning and the rockets are flying.China has a lot more to lose as they are responsible for a lot of the manufacturing around the world.Right, and A Lot more mouths to feed... Putin has his army built around him to control the general population, but good luck to contain 1.4 bn of hungry people.Putin can slow down the bleeding by collecting free money selling natural resources, would that be a lot harder for China, especially given how much the West would suffer from losing Taiwan's chips, so the response would be strong.Anyway, I'm not a war expert, and there certainly are a lot of aspects to it all.

Since 1945. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Taiwan_(1945%E2%80%93present)Ok. It is a ""cultural heritage claim"" and a ""cultural grievance"" and a ""cultural narrative"" that: 'all Chinese people are 1 Chinese People.'It is pretty much like the American South saying "" The South Will Rise again."" Or Texas saying that they will Secede again and fight a 3rd Civil War. Good luck with that theory.The Saber-Rattling has nothing to do with a desire to invade Taiwan. The purpose is to create a patriotic narrative in Mainland China. To keep Chinese people scared of Big Brother in China.China is a Technocratic Police State. They are very interested in maintaining Domestic Tranquility within their own borders. Because no Army on Earth could stop 1.4 billion people from overthrowing their own government. Ok.They don't want or need to invade Taiwan. There is no profit motivation to invade Taiwan. They already trade with them. There is no oil there. There is nothing.China would lose way too much Trade. There would be trading sanctions and they don't want that. They have 1.4 billion mouths to feed.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Chinahttps://www.worldstopexports.com/chinas-top-import-partners/https://images.app.goo.gl/pxXRMXVtEdCuVvFU9China doesn't do aggressive wars of invasion- they haven't dropped a bomb anywhere in 50 years. They don't have a huge military industry. They are not a huge weapons exporter.China's weapons exports are less than 2% of the value of the United States Domestic military budget. USA spends 50x on military each year than what China exports annually.They don't even have a Blue Water Navy-just a Coast Guard with 1 aircraft carrier.They do money lending for infrastructure deals to poor countries in Africa, Asia and South America-then charge them interest and do the construction for them and then repossess the assets if there is a default. In other words - they don't bomb they just build stuff and lend money and do trade deals.TSMC already does business in Mainland China-in Shanghai.

Following the February 28 massacre in 1947, martial law was declared in 1949 by the Governor of Taiwan Province, Chen Cheng, and the ROC Ministry of National Defense. Following the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the ROC government retreated from the mainland as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
