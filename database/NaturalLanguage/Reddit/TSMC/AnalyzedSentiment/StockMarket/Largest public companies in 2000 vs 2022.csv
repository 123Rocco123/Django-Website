,nan,MSFT and GOOGL should be in any portfolio imo. Fantastic companies.,2,nan,nan,nan

,nan,https://www.businessinsider.com/the-next-7-american-monopolies-2010-11This article linked in the article is insane tbh. If you just invested in these companies when it came out you would have done insanely well. Although the last 10 years has been one of the best bull markets its still impressive. Usually these articles suck,0,nan,nan,nan

,nan,"*operating system market - outside of windows and their office suite, the overwhelming majority of top grossing programs are not microsoft. also, hard to be a monopoly when apple, a rival software (and hardware) company is worth more.",1,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Windows has a 75% market share on computers. Google has a 72% market share on smartphones.You can probably call both a duopoly with apple i guess since it looks like they are catching up. For phones it’s really good at least, have not tries for desktop.",2,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"operating system share, not software share. you said monopoly on software market. in software, Microsoft has a 4.7% market share.",3,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"I didn’t actually say software share, but we can discuss that. How can you have monopoly on software? Which software? Its like saying having monopoly on hardware.If anyone were to have monopoly on software it would probably be microsoft tho, just by the power of installing whatever software they like with windows and it would be the most installed software over night. Ever since Teams released they have been eating away users from zoom , slack and google, to the point that i can schedule a meeting now with any company and i know it will be on teams. They even added a button for it in outlook just to make it really convenient. Now thats the power of monopoly that few can compete with.",4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,4.7% market share on software market is incredible... May I know what company have more than that?,4,nan,nan,nan
,nan,None. Since when is a market leader a monopoly?,5,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Saudi Aramco : Saudi Aramco, officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, is a Saudi Arabian public petroleum and natural gas company based in Dhahran. As of 2020, it is one of the largest companies in the world by revenue.Owned by the govt of Saudi Arabia",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"A lot of companies went in and out of favor for various reasons. I pulled in the data for 2000 and 2022 largest companies and see the difference between the 2 lists. I was expecting the two lists to be very different but still surprised to see how big the difference is. Few companies stood to the test of time, expect Microsoft and likes of Exxon from 2000. Many big companies in 2022 are no where near the top in 2000. But in general it appears that consumers and tech are the two main sectors where most companies are from.",0,nan,nan,nan
,nan,"Wait until 10 years from now. The mega tech companies will be a LOT larger. People just do not get that companies like Google have barely even got started.Google just has a massive runway to work with to keep double digit growth for at least another decade.Take a simple one. Android is the most popular operating system in the world and passed Windows years ago.Yet Google does not charge a cent. There is well ove a billion devices activated a year. Just a coupld of dollars per device would add billions to Google's bottom line as no new material expense.The thing that is really going to accelerate their growth is AI. Watch this video and tell me if you have seen anything more impressive?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avdpprICvNIAI is going to completely change the business landscape. There will be endless things likehttps://blogs.blinx.ai/predicting-3d-models-for-protein-structure-using-ais-deep-learning-software/But NOT just Google. All of the mega four will be a lot larger. Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. Each one has at least one deep moat if not multiple moats.",0,nan,nan,nan
