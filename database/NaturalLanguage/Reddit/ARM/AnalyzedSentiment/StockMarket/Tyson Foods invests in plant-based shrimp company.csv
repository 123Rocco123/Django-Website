People debate about the health and environmental impact of beef. There's much less debate about that with seafood.Shrimp can be sustainably farmed, and doesn't carry the same twinge of guilt as eating a cow.That said, I can see that artificial crab and lobster could be a huge profit center.

The reason I stopped eating meat was in college I couldn’t afford it. Meat alternatives are still fairly expensive for beyond or impossible, but a company like Tyson won’t struggle to compete those prices down.It’s not unreasonable to think Tyson could potentially subsidize alternative meats within their company to undersell market value while they scale up and reduce their internal costs of production over time.
