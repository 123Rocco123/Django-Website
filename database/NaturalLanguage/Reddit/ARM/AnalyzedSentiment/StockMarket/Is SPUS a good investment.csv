,"Hello fellow Redditors, I'm a new investor in the stock market, and I'm interested in investing in the S&P500. However, I want to avoid companies related to alcohol, arms, and other industries that conflict with my values. For this reason, I've been buying shares of the ETF called SPUS (SP Funds S&P Sharia Industry).  Before I commit further, I'd like to get some opinions and insights from this community: 1. Is SPUS a good ETF to invest in?    - Does it provide good returns compared to other S&P500 ETFs? 2. Safety and Reliability    - Is the company issuing these ETFS reputable and trustworthy?    - Are there any known concerns or red flags regarding SPUS? 3. Fees and Costs    - Are the management fees and other associated costs reasonable compared to similar ETFs? 4. Liquidity and Trading    - How liquid is SPUS? Are there any issues with buying or selling shares?   I appreciate any insights, experiences, or advice you can share about investing in SPUS. Thanks in advance for your help! :)",I liked SPUS initially but got turned off because they added AMZN to their holdings. Contacted the fund and they said it passed their Halal filters. Iâ€™m beginning to prefer HLAL to SPUS now. Another option is AMAGX.,0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
