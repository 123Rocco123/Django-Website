,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 21, 2020 Stocks continued sinking Monday, with the three major indexes extending last week’s declines. The drop continued as traders became concerned with stagnating improvement in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty, with the US presidential election around 6 weeks out. The Dow fell the hardest today, finishing 1.84% down, the Nasdaq finished 0.39% up, and the SPY was 1.07% down. Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research said, “The root causes of the recent drawdown in US large caps are [first], recent weakness in real-time economic indicators, [second] the lack of movement on a fiscal stimulus package that could offset #1 and [third] the Fed’s lackluster forecasts in its Wednesday release of the Summary of Economic Projections”. Shares of major bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), HSBC (HSBC) and Deutsche Bank (DB) fell following a report that they and other financial institutions for decades facilitated fund transactions used for allegedly criminal activities, and failed to report suspicious activity. The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found five global banks moved ""staggering sums of illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks that have spread chaos and undermined democracy around the world."" The report cited documents leaked by BuzzFeed News that identified more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity, including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank. “Reopening stocks”, or stocks benefits when the economy looks like it will reopen soon amid the pandemic, fell steeply today, as fear over coronavirus cases here and abroad led to fear of more business closure. In the US, there are now, sadly, 200,000 deaths and new cases have risen in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota, per Yahoo Finance. WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic and that a ‘very serious situation is unfolding in Europe”. Cruise stock Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) fell more than 7% in intraday trading, and airlines including United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) were each down at least 6%. Highlights After opening the day deep in the red, tech stocks like $AAPL, $AMZN, and $MSFT rallied in the last hour to end firmly green or modestly red. Tesla (TSLA) will likely partner with a Canadian mining company, Giga Metals Corp. (OTCQB:HNCKF) to source Nickel. Company claims it can source it in an environmentally friendly way. Battery day is tomorrow, we expect big things! London Mayor exploring new plans to enforce new restrictions to slow spread of virus in lieu of vaccine and more widespread testing possibilities. - Reuters**:** Alex Zukin upgraded Oracle from Sector Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $60 to $68, calling the TikTok deal a ‘shot in the arm’. Shares of Nikola (NKLA) fell sharply after it was announced that Trevor Milton, Executive Chairman and Founder, stepped away from the company in lieu of Hindenburg's allegations $MSFT acquired ZeniMAx Media, parent company of Bethesda studios, the creators of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series, in a $7.5 billion deal. Walmart (VVPR) has just announced doubling down on addressing climate crisis issues. It is targeting zero emissions across its global operation by 2040.
