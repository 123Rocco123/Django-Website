,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click ‚ÄúShow Images‚Äù at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren‚Äôt recommendations, I‚Äôm following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don‚Äôt ask about earnings because I typically don‚Äôt take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on _____?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt ___ on the watchlist?‚Äù or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you - doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I‚Äôm still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News: You already know what the news is, lol. DJT - President #45 won - stock has spiked. This is strange of me to say, but I‚Äôm biased bearish - I think P #47 will likely just go back to using X/Twitter instead of staying on TS. Watching $55 level. (Will now refer to #45 as #47 to avoid confusion.) TSLA - Spiked up as a result of Musk‚Äôs support of Pres #47. Short biased, but no position. SMCI - News from last week: auditor resigns. Fears of this being delisted and upcoming earnings are leading to big selloff, lowest it's been in the past few months. Missed their earnings report yesterday. PACS - Short report by Hindenburg 2 days ago, another massive selloff. Just watching at the moment, no bias. PLTR - Had earnings two days ago, boosted from a #47 win. Watching $55 level. GEO - Boosted from President 47 win - watching $20 level.

Thanks for the reply. Another question if you don't mind, what makes you either flip or stay with your original outlook once a certain level is met. For example when TSLA hit 300 what made you think it was bullish as opposed to thinking it could go up a little to 305 but then down to 280s as it was yesterday. Was it a wait and see approach once you saw the price keep increase and essentially rode the wave?",2,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.999
