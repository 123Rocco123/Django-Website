,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022 After one of the wildest days I’ve experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterday’s momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Markets Today S&P 500 (SPY): +0.91% Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52% Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50% Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05% Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05% Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02% Sea Limited (SE): +6.01% Albertsons (ACI): -9.56% Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83% Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14% Amazon (AMZN): +2.40% During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate. He said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.” Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.” Powell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, “What that [the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We’re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it’s a long road to normal from where we are.” The Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.” Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powell’s speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. Steven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said “We’re seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.” Regarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb."" Looking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. Moreover, at the end of the week, big financial institutions, including JP Morgan (JPM), Blackrock (BLK), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell. Highlights Intel (INTC) analysts gave a nod of approval to the chipmaker on its move to recruit Micron’s (MU) David Zinsner to serve as Chief Financial Officer as part of a broader shakeup by CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Zinsner ""has driven higher operating margins at every public company he has been CFO at."" The National Federation of Independent Business reported that its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 point to 98.9 last month. Of small business owners who responded to the organization’s survey, 22% said inflation was their primary operating concern — up from 18% in November. Tesla Inc sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday. The U.S. judge hearing the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Facebook said on Tuesday that he would not dismiss the government's lawsuit. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, is reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10 starting in May and will stop charging overdraft fees in February.

Article down below I think its a great innovation and the Tesla conccurentBlackstone Resources nominated for the Green Product Award 2022Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LRBAAR, Switzerland 12.01.2022. Blackstone Resources AG (SWX; symbol BLS, ISIN CH0460027110) is pleased to announce that we have been nominated for the Green Product Award 2022 with our 3D-printed battery cells from environmentally friendly manufacturing. 1500 participants from 54 countries applied and have now been reviewed, pre-selected and finally nominated under the aspects of design, innovation and sustainability. ""We are delighted that our 3D-printed lithium batteries have now cleared one of the final hurdles at the high-profile and ecologically valuable Green Product Award 2022 in the mobility category,"" said Ulrich Ernst, CEO of Blackstone.With 3D-printed lithium cells, Blackstone Technology GmbH (100% subsidiary of Blackstone Resources AG) produces climate-friendly and clean batteries for a sustainable change in transportation. ""With Blackstone Thick Layer Technology ©, we have developed a groundbreaking technology in-house, with which we produce reliable, high-performance battery-cells with an optimal cost-benefit ratio and particularly low environmental impact in the heart of Europe,"" says CEO Ernst.   Technical and ecological lead convinced initiatorsThis world first in the manufacturing segment allows for a significantly higher energy density of +20%, thus promising more range in electromobility, and relies on a water-based manufacturing process: the consumption of critical raw materials and chemicals is thus sustainably avoided or reduced. The manufacturing costs are also considerably lower with 3D printing compared to currently widespread production methods for lithium-ion batteries. These arguments have now also convinced the initiators of the Green Product Award.The organisers of the annual international competition for innovative, sustainable products and services were impressed: ""The nominated entry '3D-printed lithium batteries' shows how a mix of sustainability, design and innovation can reconcile a good lifestyle with a more sustainable future,"" says Nils Bader, director of the Green Future Club and initiator of the Green Product Award.On May 18th., the Green Product Award ceremony will take place in Munich's ARRI cinema, it is one of the top events of the Munich Creative Business Week. In addition to the winners, the first collaborations between the participants will be announced then, organised by the Green Future Club.",0,0.529,1.0,POSITIVE
