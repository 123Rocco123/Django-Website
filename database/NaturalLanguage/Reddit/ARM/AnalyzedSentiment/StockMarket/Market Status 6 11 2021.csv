,"Market Status: Uptrend (5/5) The stock market maintains its strong uptrend for the time being. Next week is a deciding factor whether we can take a breath of relief or not. If we don't get too many distribution days (days that close lower than the previous day on higher volume), we will have three of them roll off the map, giving the market flexibility to hold more. As a side note, distribution days are not necessarily a bad thing. They are necessary for the market to move higher. On a positive note, the $QQQ has gone six days without a single distribution day. If you have joined any of our weekly zoom sessions, you know by now how much I love it when stocks reach their all-time-high zones. The $SPY is in the all-time high zone, and the $QQQ is approaching a breakout into an all-time high. The market is looking strong and healthy for now, but always remember that the market doesn't care what I think, so always keep your risk management stop-losses armed and ready ðŸŽ“.",Go with long-term investing. This is hands down the best tool I've found for finding great companies: https://www.easyfinancialcharts.com/c/dashboard/tsla,0,0.531,0.958,POSITIVE
