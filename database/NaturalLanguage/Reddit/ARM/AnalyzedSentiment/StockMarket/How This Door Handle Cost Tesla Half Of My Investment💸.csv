,"Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes. If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more. However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well. One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle... Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors? Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow. This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this. James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get. Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport. I believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does). I've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla. Tesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too... When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government. Seeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now. What do you think?",Never ever invest in Chinese stock. Not worth the risk.,0,0.575,1.0,NEGATIVE

The reason why Grab is that much more expensive is that they charge 30% while inDrive charges ~10.5%.Also when you're from Europe or the US you can basically ""fund"" your transaction fees for cash withdrawl by saving using inDrive over Grab :)Even though I'm from Germany, I don't have any German stock or other investments in Germany, I'm well positioned in the US but want to diversify more and more into the Asian region as I see what's happening in the West.

They are the most affordable electric car you can get here and it is overall quite good.Traditional car manufacturers had to lobby and had a tax for electric cars reinstated because they fear this cars will be popular, they also reduced the prices for a lot of models so they are more in line with byds.I'm not sure of those cars will last, but it is clear they are trying to get to the Brazilian market and it seems they are making it, which is a feat in itself as the easiest way to lose money is to sell in Brazil, I think tesla doesn't even consider ever selling here.",0,0.533,0.992,POSITIVE
,"Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes. If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more. However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well. One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle... Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors? Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow. This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.

If China/ASEAN taxes the same percentage on US EVs as the US does on ASEAN EVs, they'd still be able to sell to the US, however Tesla would not be able to sell to ASEAN as they price would just go through the roof and I can image that happening in a lot of different places around the world.",1,0.527,0.998,NEGATIVE
