,"Stocks closed slightly on the red, with the three major indexes fluctuating between small gains and losses in another choppy session. Market participants continue to digest elevated commodity prices, the September job report, new upcoming economic data, and earnings season, which is set to kick off later this week. In recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. The broad rise in prices threatens to further pressure corporate margins, with companies already dealing with a host of supply-side disruptions, including port congestion, ongoing power shortages in China, and labor market imbalances. Rising treasury yields also raise the specter of higher borrowing costs, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury hovering at the highest levels since June. David Bailin, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Private Bank (a subsidiary of Citigroup), said, “We’re definitely freaked out about crude oil prices ... [and] about slightly higher interest rates. But we have to put all of this in context. First of all, interest rates have been abnormally low. Energy prices are high due to excessive demand right now and delivery shortages across Europe and now in China ... These things will abate. We think it'll take somewhere between three and nine months for energy supplies and for the shipping issues to abate."" I agree. Looking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Stagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned."" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. Earnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting. Highlights The IMF's new forecast is for global economic activity to expand at a 5.9% rate this year, down from the 6.0% pace seen in July. However, the IMF maintained its outlook for 4.9% growth next year. To put this into context, global growth rates in 2019 were 3.2%, so the IMF thinks we are poised for at least another year of nice gains.

If they don't reduce availability of new ARM processors and reduce competition, they'd only be making what ARM was making, and a lot more value than that is baked in already.
