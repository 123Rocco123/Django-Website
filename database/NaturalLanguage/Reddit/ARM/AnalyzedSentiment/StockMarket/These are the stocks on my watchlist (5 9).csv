,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.

HOOD- Beats earnings with 0.18 vs 0.05 expected, revenue of 618M vs 534M expected. Keeps FY 24 guidance. Note that they are still under SEC investigation for non-stock and non-option listings. GME- We saw massive momentum Friday at the close, then again Monday in the morning. It hasn’t retraced the move for the last 4 days, so still worth keeping an eye on. $17 level worth watching. NVDA- Interesting sell off this morning, worth watching to see if we break lows and sell off rest of day. ARM- Reports earnings of 0.36 vs 0.30 expected, revenue of 928M vs 885M expected. FY25 was guided to be below estimates. Longer-term watches: NVDA/SMCI, BA, ULTA, TSLA",I had the funniest feeling to sell robinhood yesterday.
