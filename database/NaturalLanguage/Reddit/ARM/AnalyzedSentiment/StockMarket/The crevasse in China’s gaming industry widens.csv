,"After China’s crackdown process blocked Huya (HUYA) and DouYu (DOYU) from merging, forming what would be the equivalent of Amazon’s Twitch, things continue to unravel for Asia’s gaming industry. Tencent (TCEHY), a major shareholder of Huya, has re-ignited its own separate gaming segment, which could even compete directly with both Huya and DouYu (still an unknown). At the same time, China is cutting the time minors can play per day to 1h (below 18), which could still play positively for gaming platforms (less resources used up by non-paying users). But here is where things can turn bad for investors: In the past Sina (now private) was a tech company that owned Weibo (WB), the equivalent of Twitter (TWTR). For various reasons, Sina’s market value wouldn’t move higher even though the value of its shares (in Weibo), justified a much higher price (100%+). Eventually the company was taken private and investors lost their money. And it was taken private at an exceptionally low price (the market price at the time, plus a minor premium), which was clearly fraudulent, to say the least (the company’s CEO bought the company! - a person who had a motive to make sure the stock price remained undervalued). Now the same is happening with other companies (ex. JoYY) and the same could happen with Huya and DoYou. Investors should be very careful and cut back on their holdings. It’s better to lose some, than lose it all. China is just too unpredictable at the moment. Still, there is no doubt that prices could soar at some point (50%+ gains).

Breakup addictions. In China, kids are hooked to them. Parents can not break them away. Skip school, do not do home work. So they mandate the service provider to turn on gaming during certain hours and on weekend only. They will monitor groups > 10 people access see if there are violations. This means less advertisement. Wechat is too big to be destroyed. They have banking, microblog, social media and music etc.",2,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
