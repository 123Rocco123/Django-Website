Buy today, sell tomorrow after it appreciates, if it goes down, hold one more day, buy at the lowest possible price to lower your average, and then sell the next day when it exceeds your new average cost.Rinse and repeat.I should mention I also never wager much (never more than 10-15% of my balance), and I never get close to the expiration date of the option.

,,"I‚Äôm not sure I understand the question.I‚Äôll give you an example, right now, I bought two AAPL $270 1/17/2025 expiration calls for $234/contract. I‚Äôll sit on those until they‚Äôre worth more than $234/option. (Right now, it‚Äôs looking like a bad buy, because they‚Äôre worth $206 per right now, but you can‚Äôt win them all. The goal is just to be more green than red, and I‚Äôve been more green than red this year.)This whole year has been pretty bullish, so I‚Äôm probably just riding the trend of the general stock market.But the goal is to capitalize big time on the up years, and try to avoid the down years as much as possible.",4,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Trying to avoid theta decay.The closer you get to the expiration date, the more like gambling this whole deal becomes. Might as well go to Vegas and plop the money down on a roulette table if you‚Äôre doing 0-7 DTEs.If the expiration date is far out, there‚Äôs still a lot that can happen between now and the expiration date.
