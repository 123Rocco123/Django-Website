,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 7, 2021 Wrote this on Friday’s Recap: ""On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip buying. As usual I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market, and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess."" My point with highlighting is this: the market loves to overreact. Do your own research, stick to your convictions, never listen to mainstream media, but be prepared to react to anything. The market loves overreacting, both to the upside and downside, reality is always somewhere in the middle. Stocks extend gains from yesterday with a huge bounce today after new Omicron data coming out of South Africa suggests the severity of the variant is less than originally expected and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. In other news, the People’s Bank of China recommitted to accommodative monetary policy in the country in an effort to stimulate growth. This is notable at a time when other Central Banks across the world are tightening policy. Notable Numbers Today S&P 500 (SPY): +2.04% Nasdaq (QQQ): 3.01% Dow Jones (DIA): +1.38% Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.30% Volatility Index: -15.34% Apple (AAPL): +3.54% NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.96% Ford Motors (F): 3.85% NovaVax (NVAX): +28.87% Square (SQ): +5.27% Some encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, “Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. But we’ve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.” China’s Central Bank cut its capital reserve requirement ratio for banks in the region, meaning they could lend out more money and boost growth. This is interesting given most other Central Banks around the world, including the US, have started tightening monetary policy. After a massive 25% spike in the Volatility Index (VIX) last week, the fear index lost all its gains in two trading days, a sign that market participants remain bullish and eager to buy up any dips in the market. Alongside concerns of the Omicron variant, investors have also been ascertaining when and how robustly the Federal Reserve will move to accelerate its asset-purchase tapering program and raise interest rates from their current near-zero levels as inflationary pressures continue to mount. On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release its November Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is expected to show the fastest year-over-year rise in core consumer prices since 1991, at a 4.6% annual gain. Tech and growth stocks are the longest-duration assets, which means they're going to be the most negatively impacted in valuation by any bump up in inflation which would take interest rates up. But on the other hand, what the Fed is doing and is even talking about doing, which is going from accommodative to more restrictive monetary policy, is known."" Highlights Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for ""green"" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores. Ford partnered with Salesforce (CRM) to launch new SaaS software for Ford’s commercial and services unit. In similar news, automakers Stellantis rolled out its new software strategy today, with a 2030 target of 20 billion euros in annual revenue. Twitter (TWTR) announced it was acquiring messaging platform Quill in an effort to improve messaging tools in the social media. Based on Salesforce technology, the system will digitize paperwork for contractors, repair technicians and other trades people, and start at $39 per month per user, Ford said. Apple (AAPL) signed an agreement with the Chinese government worth an eye-watering $275 billion to placate threats that would hurt their devices and services in the country. As part of the agreement, Apple promised to use more components from Chinese suppliers in its devices, sign deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate on technology with Chinese universities and directly invest in Chinese tech companies. Intel (INTC) rose 3% after the company announced it planned to spin off its self-driving unit Mobileye into a company. The IPO is set for 2022, with Intel hanging on to a majority of the company. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday argued that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia Corp carries out its acquisition of Arm. Sad to say, since NVDA is my favorite company and largest holding, but doesn’t seem like the Arm deal will go through in the end. **Please note that price target upgrades were written during the session and may not reflect closing prices** Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $164 to $200 at Overweight.
