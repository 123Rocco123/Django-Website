,"Market Status: Uptrend (4/5) (Distribution day - A sell-off day where the market closes lower than the previous day on higher volume) Though yesterday gave us a scare, we survived the week, remaining in a general market uptrend. Though most distribution days are in the less significant zones for both the $SPY and $QQQ, there are quite a few of them, and gaining two or three more next week could tip the market over to the downside. For next week, we have only one distribution day scheduled to fall off both the $SPY and $QQQ, so it will serve as a significant week to see the continued strength of the market. The current market activity is due to its approach of the resistance lines for both the $SPY and $QQQ as they reach their all-time-high marks. Perhaps there will be a lot of breakouts in the upcoming weeks? (not hopeful on next week) There is also the side of sell-offs as people try to recoup what they lost or make profits. There is absolutely no way to know until it happens, so keep your stop-losses armed and ready.",What is $SPY and $QQQ ?,0,0.518,0.999,NEGATIVE

The $QQQ is an ETF that tracks the NASDAQ, which is the bench mark for tech stocks.",1,0.537,0.798,NEGATIVE
