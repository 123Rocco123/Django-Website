His goal is to keep a low profile. I like his humbleness but, I also think that he could have more success by attracting media. Regardless, he has already raised $600M. His net worth is 1.9B. There is a rumor that CEO Peter Szulczewski wanted 10B for his e-commerce platform and will likely not settle for less.   Conclusion E-commerce remains to be a highly profitable business. What makes WISH stand out from big players like Amazon and Alibaba? The thing that stands out to me the most about WISH, is the low prices. WISH is essentially a discount Amazon which is attractive to many consumers. How does WISH maintain such attractive prices? WISH allows you to buy straight from the factory. By cutting out the middleman, WISH can maintain low prices at the cost of less quality control. Another reason for low prices is that wish uses a lot of merchants from China. Whenever you buy a product from WISH, it is likely to be made in China. I will admit that I found it difficult to find some of the key valuation metrics like PE, PEG, Gross Margin, and Long Term Debt. This concerned me at first, but I believe that part of the reason is due to the fact that WISH is fairly new to the market. The fact that Amazon and Alibaba have approached WISH not only tells me that WISH has potential, but also the ability to steal away market share. **This is not investment advice** **Do your own research**","Hello!
