They gather and handle data too, but mainly for the purpose of analyzing them rather than provide a cloud storage as a service.Many cloud data warehouse (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGLE) initially provide hosting service for data/content storage mainly, then naturally adding on data analytics to analyze data and finding patterns. SNOW is somewhere in between - their strength is data analysis, but they provide cloud data warehouse (by using AMZN, MSFT, GOOGLE cloud service) so that their software can function. SNOW's (and AMZN, MSFT, GOOGLE) client base are more of enterprises.There is no reason PLTR and SNOW cannot compete for each other's business, just a matter of emphasis, capital availability, and marketing drive. In fact, I am certain that AMZN/MSFT/GOOGLE/SNOW has gov entities as clients as well, and PLTR has commercial enterprises as clients. PLTR can very well do exactly what SNOW does - bundle its data analytics with cloud data warehouse of AMAN , MSFT, GOOG and serving enterprise clients (if they haven't done that already.

SNOW price action is not pretty. If it close above yesterday’s close with such heavy volume, this trade will most likely fail.I have been holding back on shorts for a while, wary of a “rip your face off” bounce, and stayed away from all Wood stocks. To answer your question, this trade was driven by a high conviction that SNOW is in no competitive position to command such extreme premium and its ER will likely disappoint. Also, my macro outlook turned more negative recently. Thought I will be in and out in a day or two as usual – we bet on specific events but not directions in these trades in general, even though we have our views - but did not expect such a powerful rally today.Thought about exiting near open with a modest gain, but decided to stay. We always bet with modest size on any individual trade, so it will be fine. Still have a few days to see where the price settles.Happy trading!",1,0.515,0.997,NEGATIVE
