,"Marathon patent group So, I’ve been following cryptocurrency mining companies since about August of 2020. The big players in this sector, as far as momentum in the last 6 months, have been Riot blockchain and Marathon Patent Group. They’ve had the tendency of being two peas in a pod. That being said, they’ve constantly played a game of cat and mouse as far as price action, and that price action is for the most part a direct correlation with the price of Bitcoin. Unless you live under a rock, you’ve seen the bull cycle with bitcoin on a rampage this year. So about the two companies: Marathon patent group currently has a higher number of outstanding shares and a higher market cap than riot Blockchain does, which tends to dictate the stock price differences. The business model of these two is nearly identical, with the exception of the potential amount of s19 pro miners currently in the state of an arms race. Riot to this date has about 20% more, so technically monthly profit should slightly higher. But... Marathon Patent group has 100,000 miners on order to be installed throughout the course of 2021. This is three times the amount the Riot will have. If bitcoin continues this run for at least the course of the year, the profit of Marathon will definitely exceed that of Riot. Current stock price of marathon is ~43, with riot ~71. These two have historically had a rubber band effect with one rallying above the other, and then the following week or so the one that didn’t skyrocket ultimately skyrockets above the other. Not saying that this is a guarantee to continue happening, as nothing is guaranteed in the market, but looks like the past is certainly on course to repeat itself. Has anyone here been following these and have something interesting to add on/thoughts on inner working of business model/ general input about findings of the companies? I would appreciate any insight for, or against these companies so don’t be afraid to roast them if you have strong reason to. I personally see incredible value in the future for them. Thanks!","On the rubberband case, couldn’t the opposite be true in that rather than Mara pops to catch up, riot just plummets back down?I held riot for $4 to $17, and seeing it over $70 a few months later, even with the price of BTC where it is, makes me feel like both are quite overvalued.And what happens to these companies when Bitcoin is completely mined? The algorithm won’t release any additional coins beyond 21 million, and currently we’re around 18.6M in circulation.On the short term, yeah there’s a good chance the Mara play will work over the next couple of weeks. But I’d be very nervous to hold either of these for an extended period",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thanks!","Right, I know how the mining algorithm curve works (at a high level) and what the release schedule looks like (basically the cryptographic complexity increases with each coin mined). I’m just skeptical of the valuation and long term profitability of MARA and RIOT. But again, probably a good play in the short term.",2,0.522,0.608,POSITIVE
