,"Market Notes: The markets post 3 red days in a row to close the week out on a low note. After posting all-time highs a small pullback is not uncommon. This week is the quarterly triple witching when a lot of options, index futures, and index options expire at the same time on Friday. The December triple witching is typically bullish. The PFE vaccine is on its way to an arm near you. As distribution is beginning across the nation expect the news to focus on that. The market's already priced it in. Futures are up. I'm still bullish. This is the last full week of the year. Let's finish strong.
