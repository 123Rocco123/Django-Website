Looking for long term investment, try to use strategy 40-40-20 40% super low risky 40% stable 20% a bit risky Also want to have some part with dividends My portfolio is VOO: 40% of Total Portfolio AAPL: 14% of Total Portfolio AXP: 9% of Total Portfolio KO: 4% of Total Portfolio ABT: 3% of Total Portfolio LLY: 4.5% of Total Portfolio NVDA: 7.5% of Total Portfolio BAC: 7.5% of Total Portfolio ARM: 5% of Total Portfolio ALAB: 5% of Total Portfolio What you can suggest? How to improve it?","The whole point of VOO is that it encompasses the top 503 companies in the US market.AAPL is 6.89%, NVDA is 6.2% of VOO etc. You are adding weight to two of the heaviest already.https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/voo/vanguard-sp-500-etf#portfolioIf you want to reduce risk go with something like RSP which is even weighted and then you are not overweight AAPL, NVDA etc. You may also want to add some small caps like IWM.",0,0.526,POSITIVE,0.849

How to improve it?","My immediate reaction is you have a lot of seperate assets with overlapping interests and as another comment mentioned, VOO already owns other stuff. Fun thought exercise, you want 40-40-20? If you could only choose 5 stocks rather than 10, which ones would you cut?",0,0.511,POSITIVE,0.822

But I guess I need to decrease AAPL and NVDA",1,0.51,NEGATIVE,1.0
