You really can't compare Hulu/D+'s selection to Netflix. HBO has some great stuff, but their quantity is nothing next to Netflixes catalogue size.So yeah, all these people screaming about how they're cancelling is typical overblown Reddit behavior IMO.

Lots of people might get fed up and cancel. All the streaming services are watching too see if it works.My co-worker goes to his in-laws cabin out of state and says he uses his Netflix there. He’s pissed because now that TV won’t get shit without a dedicated separate account. The other option is physically bringing the cabin TV home just to login. Not feasible.Lots of users who aren’t even abusing password sharing will get caught up in this.Netflix is the sacrificial goat to test this on.

This is one the hardest facts for people on Reddit to understand, but your personal preferences are not the same as the whole market.Netflix has a ton of data. Companies like this don’t just randomly shit out policies like this. They do extensive analysis of the data they have, categorize their customers, figure out who’s paying, who’s sharing, who’s free riding, and use those numbers. Chances are, they looked at the data and realized people who do travel, don’t travel more than 31 days. Or that people connecting from military base IPs don’t double use their accounts. They most likely ran some market analysis and realized the money they’d make will be greater than the small number of subscribers they lose.This is how these companies make policy decisions. Unlike most people here, they don’t just go with gut feelings. That’s why time and time again, you see Redditors just hate on a company when it’s down and/or doing something they don’t like, but the company ends up making more money and rallies. It’s all about what the broad market wants, not what you want.",0,0.534,0.997,NEGATIVE
