This is one the hardest facts for people on Reddit to understand, but your personal preferences are not the same as the whole market.Netflix has a ton of data. Companies like this don‚Äôt just randomly shit out policies like this. They do extensive analysis of the data they have, categorize their customers, figure out who‚Äôs paying, who‚Äôs sharing, who‚Äôs free riding, and use those numbers. Chances are, they looked at the data and realized people who do travel, don‚Äôt travel more than 31 days. Or that people connecting from military base IPs don‚Äôt double use their accounts. They most likely ran some market analysis and realized the money they‚Äôd make will be greater than the small number of subscribers they lose.This is how these companies make policy decisions. Unlike most people here, they don‚Äôt just go with gut feelings. That‚Äôs why time and time again, you see Redditors just hate on a company when it‚Äôs down and/or doing something they don‚Äôt like, but the company ends up making more money and rallies.
