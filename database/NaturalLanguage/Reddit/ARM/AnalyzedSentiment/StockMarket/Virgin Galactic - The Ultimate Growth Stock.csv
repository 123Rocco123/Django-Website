,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012.

The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets. So what do you think about NYSE:SPCE? It would be interesting to know your thoughts!","Think it’s horribly overpriced and a lot of people are holding really heavy bags from the nonsensical run-up it saw before it’s recent launch (which had quite a few problems that they only acknowledged after the flight was over)Heck, even Branson himself unloaded a TON of SPCE stock during the run-up",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots.

Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets. So what do you think about NYSE:SPCE? It would be interesting to know your thoughts!","I’m just saying it all seems bearish to me.A lot of people holding heavy losses because they bought into hype without knowing about the industry. The company founder offloaded billions of dollars in stock. The spaceflight experienced a lot of technical problems that are going to make it hard to gain a market share in an industry where their immediate competitors are significantly ahead in their capabilities.Space travel sounds great and all but we are still very far away from legitimate commercial applications of it and Virgin Galactic is trailing mightily in what they are capable of doing. The market is going to be dominated by the players who gain trust and lower costs first, and those are going to be the companies like SpaceX with outrageously superior technology and R&D",2,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA).

Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets. So what do you think about NYSE:SPCE? It would be interesting to know your thoughts!","I don’t think you understand this market, to be honest. No one is ‘catering to tourists’ right now because we aren’t nearly as close to commercial space flight as these recent launches and media buzz wants people to believe. Technological capabilities are what matters in this market because the real first-mover is going to be the company who can build infrastructure efficiently enough to commercialize. Capability-wise, SpaceX is far ahead of Blue Origin, who is far ahead of Virgin Galactic. The current mission statements or directives of these companies has minimal impact on the eventual outcome here. The most technologically-equipped player is going to dominate this market when it becomes profitable to do so.That’s fine you disagree, but I won’t personally be buying. I wouldn’t be touching this market in general because it’s ripe with a severely unjustified level of hype in relation to the types of returns people are expecting.",4,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies.

The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets. So what do you think about NYSE:SPCE? It would be interesting to know your thoughts!","$RKLB, rocketlab",0,0.5,0.755,POSITIVE
,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme.

Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight.

Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

,"Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company. It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview. WHAT DO THEY DO? Virgin Galactic operate in commercial sub-orbital tourism and scientific research, and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming the first company in history to take a private citizen into space. The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions. The company uses a unique method of flight into space, with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company. The customer will be given a multi-day experience, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO, to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM. Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures (formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites), the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems. In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. The company was wrongly criticised at the time for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme. VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity. Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track. The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile. In March 2021 the company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine. Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed (with 85% of the components being fabricated), and previous earnings calls outline a desire to expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years. However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; providing increased cabin capacity and altitude. This new design is aimed at scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production. VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected. There is perhaps room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft, as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open. In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below. BACKERS AND CONSUMERS Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital. An significant indirect investment comes from the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and has since received strong institutional and retail backing. As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage, and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is expected to rollout in 2025before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use. Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation, meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft. Notable relationships include Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating, and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads as part of the Flight Opportunities programme. The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government and the opportunity for potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan. FINANCIALS & VALUATION The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business. The company has also demonstrated its highly selective customer process for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000. The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays. Currently tickets cost $450,000 (up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight), and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight. After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest. The company also functions in both private and government research sectors, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight. Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate $1B annually per spaceport from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships. The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughly $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand. In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19. Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector.
