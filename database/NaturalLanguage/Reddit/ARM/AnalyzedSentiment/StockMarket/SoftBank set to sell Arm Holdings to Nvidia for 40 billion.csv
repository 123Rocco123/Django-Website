Though next gen ARM wouldn't be slated for another decade or two and current users of ARMv8 perpetual licenses (Apple, etc) continue to license instruction set compatibility indefinitely, nvidia could potentially be super anticompetitive by attempting to push new ARM versions in the future in ways that could block out competition (a la not offering perpetual licenses, demanding super high royalties, etc). But I would imagine doing so would push those like Apple currently opting for ARM to develop their own architecture or opting for another one. Apple's made it pretty clear though that they'd be willing to go their own way with CPU architecture and could simply adhere to industry standard instruction set compatibility, so they'll be fine.

,"SoftBank keeps on making headlines. They just announced that they're going to sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia. Just in case you aren't aware, the majority of all mobile phones currently in existence is using ARM processors using IP owned by Arm Holdings. Also, Apple recently abandoned Intel's x64 CPUs in favour of a new ARM-based architecture for their new line of MacBooks. Nvidia used to be all about GPUs, then they expanded into the HPC market and now they might even expand into the mobile device market. Who knows. Where do you think this is going?

Nvidia could try to pressure Apple into increasingly relying on their GPUs instead of AMD's, for example, but that might actually break competition law.",1,0.543,0.996,NEGATIVE

It's hard to tell how much of that was just general tech bullishness and how much could be attributed to the ARM acquisition effect. But ARM chatter didn't send them down in any way before.Would be interesting to see what it does pre-market tomorrow.,0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think the fact they are exploring this option is a positive indicator the Nvidia is sealing to expand horizontally and offer additional products and services to spur growth.Look at their comeback and track them up to this point. They have had really good leadership and excellent products driving the company back from the brink of bankruptcy. They are expanding horizontally to expand their product line to drive future growth in other growing business sectors. They, along with every tech company, are overvalued at the moment, but long term they appear to be a good pick up once the market shakes out and if their stock falls a bit. Market cap is way too high to be sustainable.",0,0.582,0.985,POSITIVE
