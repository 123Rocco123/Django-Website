,"Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice, make your own decisions. Current Position: Long shares (very small position relative to portfolio) The Good: -SENS sells EGM’s (Continuous Glucose Monitor) for diabetes - basically it’s a patch on your arm you wear instead of getting pricked by needles to test you blood levels -I hate needles/finger pricks, and this technology doesn’t require you to prick yourself with a needle. That alone should be enough but their CGM’s last for up to 90 days and they are creating 180 day and 365 day CGM’s. Their competitors are roughly 10-15 days. Not to mention it’s a needle vs a capsule that gets implanted under your skin *I don’t have diabetes but literally just hate needles so I think there could be value here lol* -Their CGM’s can alert you thru your smartwatches/smartphones -Accomplished management team, they just pump out patents -They are just breaking into the US market as sales in USA only $3M last year (2019) as most sales came from Europe roughly $18M (2019). -Projected revenue of 12-15M – currently that is on pace through the first 2 quarters of 2021 (Revenue: 1Q-21 & 2Q-21 was $2.8M & $3.3M respectively, a 15% increase QoQ -Ascensia partnership appears to be going well – Ascensia is control of marketing and other commercial tasks while Senseonics can now focus solely on product development -System Accuracy is leading the industry – SENS product is roughly 8% more accurate than the industry -They are in the process of developing 180 day and 360 day EGM’s (not sure when these will be ready for market though or what the time frame is with FDA approval on these) but I think the 180 day EGM’s are being used in Europe already The Bad: -Hemorrhaging cash -Lots of Debt -COVID CRUSHED their revenues in 2020 -COVID is delaying a lot of FDA approvals to move along with clinical trials for the longer lasting CGM’s etc. -Very speculative play, high risk, potentially high reward -Don't see them being profitable any time soon Financials: Financials honestly look pretty brutal which is expected for a biotech type of company – but I think they may have turned the corner here and we could be seeing an improvement. A long term look at Revenue, COGS, Gross Profit & overall profitability looks quite bleak – but if you focus on the past 5 quarters there looks to be improvement. I think this shows the partnership with Ascensia is going well thus far and the product actually has positive Gross Margins for the past 4 quarters: Not great Some hope Yikes Double yikes Still, this company is grossly unprofitable which is extremely concerning to me even despite the improvement in Revenues and GP in the past 4 quarters. You can barely even see the Revenue bar relative to the Loss of the company. I’m totally speculating, but it almost looks as if the best course of action for this company would be to be bought out by one of its major competitors for their technology, like Dexcom for example. Regardless, I think if the technology is truly this great and THAT MUCH better than the competition, then it’s a small risk I’m open to take. Looking forward to hearing what people think about this company and their technology as I am no medical expert by any means…",I'm in with money I don't mind losing.I see it as pretty long term though.They've a lot of work to do to be viable to the market leader. But as long as they can keep their head above water long enough my money is literally on them to do so.Once they can do everything Dexcom can do and the implant lasts a year I don't see why anyone would still choose Dexcom.Doctors will tell you it's a shit procedure changing it but once it lasts long enough that won't matter. It certainly doesn't stop women getting the contraceptive implant.There's other things to overcome too but I don't see why they can't. Essential it's in Beta testing as far as I'm concerned with revisions to come.They just need to advance to the point patients deem it worth it.Best case scenario I'm eying $100 a share with current float size. But I'm in at $2. So should have plenty time to react if it goes tits up.,0,0.55,0.999,NEGATIVE
