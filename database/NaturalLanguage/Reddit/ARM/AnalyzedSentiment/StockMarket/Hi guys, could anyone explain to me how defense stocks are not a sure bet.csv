,"Title says it all. Regardless of recent geopolitical developments, it seems that we will always have armies and war. Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?",If Trump gets serious about a balanced budget there is no way the defense budget is not affected.It's not clear how it will shake-out with us reducing funding of NATO or the UN and the replacement money coming form European countries might end up going to Russia or China not US military companies.He's already started busting their balls about overcharging.If contracts are restored to fixed payments for fixed results instead of the hourly charade that is done now all of the defense companies are going to take hits to top and bottom lines.I think these are longer term risk with a one to two year horizon on them but you would want to follow the Trump train closely to see when these changes start going into affect.,0,0.529,0.998,NEGATIVE
,"Title says it all. Regardless of recent geopolitical developments, it seems that we will always have armies and war. Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?","People will always want to rent movies, so Blockbuster never innovated or changed their business model to adapt with a changing environment. Opps...While there's still demand for movie ""rentals,"" other's have come up with much better ways of supplying the demand leaving Blockbuster completely in the dust. This can happen in any industry including defense. Just look at LMT after Trump started tweeting about the ridiculously expensive F-35 program.",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?","And what happened to LMT after Trumps tweeting about the F35? LMT up 3% in the last month, up 28% in the last 1 year. Comparing the largest defense contractor in the world to Blockbuster does not make sense.",1,0.564,1.0,NEGATIVE

Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?","I understand your analogy, but it simply dosent work to compare a movie rental service to massive defense companies such as LMT. LMT is also up since the incident, it's nothing more than a blip on the radar.",1,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?",Trump is planning on reworking the calculation of the deficit to get rid of exports that are immediately shipped out of the country which is expecting to raise the deficit significantly...All these defense companies which are supposed to benefit from the huge spending on military/etc... aren't going to get it...Especially with the economy moving into an inflationary period so the govt won't increase taxes to justify spending on the military.Edit: confusing eords,0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Title says it all. Regardless of recent geopolitical developments, it seems that we will always have armies and war. Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?","It Depends on your definition of sure bet. If it means there will always be arms suppliers, then yes. If it means that if you invest in a defense company it will grow and give you an adequate return on your investment then no. Defense companies are subject to many macro events outside their control from budget decisions, to elections, to geopolitical factors, etc. in that sense they are like any other stock.",0,0.544,0.998,NEGATIVE

,"Title says it all. Regardless of recent geopolitical developments, it seems that we will always have armies and war. Surely defence stocks of an average arms manufacturer is a very sure bet?","there will always be armies and warThat's probably a sure bet, at least over any of our investment horizons. But that's a sure bet on future market demand for defense products, not necessarily on defense stock prices.The uncertainty with stock prices comes from a lot of factors. Let's say you pick your favorite arms manufacturer and buy shares. If the markets go down generally tomorrow, it's likely that your stock will go down as well. Maybe another company finds a way to produce competitive products much more cheaply than the company you hold, so people sell shares in favor of the new company. Maybe the growth in demand for arms slows for a period, and people sell shares in favor of other market sectors. Maybe the management team at the company you hold lets costs get out of control and hurt profitability, or make risky investments to expand the business that don't pay off. Maybe there are new regulations on a specific portion of the market where your company earns most of their profits.There are countless risks, and that's why nothing is a sure bet.",0,0.585,1.0,NEGATIVE
