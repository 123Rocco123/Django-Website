,"Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon? (Here's the background info in case you missed the news https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY) Apple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well (https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA. When they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market ""Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets. NVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share."" Most of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely : Cash Per Share ratio has gone up from 2 to 17.5 And they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is. LT debt/total assets has decreased, total long term debt hasn't increased since last year Not only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.

This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.

Most of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer.
