I lived and worked there for a while, and also I’m Mandarin speaker.Actually, Xi or CCP didn’t steal anything from Jack Ma. There are two situations in China. First kind is obvious, you have someone backed you in CCP so your business growing really fast.The other kind is, you are growing very fast and CCP will come to ask their share in the business. The bigger business has became, the more control they will ask for. If you say no? Nobody alive said NO to CCP.That’s the reason why EVERY big Chinese company are forced include official CCP representative unit. And for those mega ones, CCP own a seat in the board and this member have VETO on everything. Which means you can’t do anything without CCP’s permission.The reason Alibaba or other Tech company is who they are is because they are backed by CCP from very early stage.Remember Uber? Amazon? Google? FB? They basically killed it everywhere but China. And you believe that’s because of culture difference? The only difference here is CCP. American companies could never compete with CCP backed companies in China.So, no, Xi or CCP didn’t steal anything. They ALWAYS own the business. They own EVERYTHING, no matter its people’s life, property or integrity.I would like to close my comment with some wisdom words a Chinese elder shares with me: “ You earned couple millions, it’s yours.
