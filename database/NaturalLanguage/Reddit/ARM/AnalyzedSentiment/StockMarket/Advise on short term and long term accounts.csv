,I’ve got a long term account that I add money into every month (plus a percentage of any bonus or other income goes there) which have made decent profit gains for the last few years. but recently I opened a short term account where I buy and sell a single stock after 5%-10%profit. I use USD100k and put all of it into one stock before the market opens (today was ARM) and if I sell now I stand to make $7k. Sometimes I’ll wait a few days before selling but usually I reach it within the day. The next day I might buy the same stock if there’s good potential or buy a different stock completely. (CELH is a personal favourite and is up 5% today) After I’ve reached the profit goal I sell and don’t look at the market until the next day. So far this has been very successful for me but I would like to know if there are better ways to work a short term account. Is this lower risk than calls and options etc? Does anyone do anything similar?,It sounds like you have a solid strategy in place for both your long term and short term accounts! It's great to see that you're actively managing your investments and finding success with your short term trades. Have you considered diversifying your short term account with different types of stocks or even exploring other short term investment options like options trading? It might be worth looking into to see if you can further optimize your portfolio and minimize risk. Keep up the good work and continue to adapt and evolve your investment approach for even greater success!,0,0.526,0.998,POSITIVE

Aside from the psychological impact, financially I doubt it would beat a well curated buy and hold strategy. Nonetheless, this active portfolio has well complimented your other holdings. It still makes a lot of sense.And, Unless you want to be extremely technical and have ample time to follow the market, options will only amplify the risks. Even the margin accounts.",0,0.533,0.998,POSITIVE
