,,I believe that's their move the ARM architecture is better in many ways and catching up in computing power where x86 dominated.,0,0.512,0.982,POSITIVE
,,"I understand a good amount about computers but is ARM really competitive in terms of higher end? I can see phones for sure, but I can't see myself buying an ARM CPU for video editing, unless I'm completely misunderstanding and ARM is actually that powerful. Guess I always assumed it was just a lower performance, lower power and heat type of CPU for things like phones or 3DS or similar things. Apples move to ARM for their computers has me a bit confused.",1,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,This is my go to guy to understand computing trends.https://youtu.be/eXhlDt2SD8oHe published this vid a couple months ago about ARM tech,2,0.519,0.963,POSITIVE
,,"Meh CPU architecture generally drives performance in a more esoteric kind of way. that is not to say it does not have an impact but it tends to be less ""hey I made this processor 20% faster"" and more ""hey, I improved the branch prediction which means that we avoid instruction cache misses in situation xyz which depending on the program being run will improve speed between 0 and 1000% with the overwhelming number of programs being much closer to that 0% mark"". makes it a bit hard to directly compare because without a ton of context or some kind of benchmark test.That said in anything battery powered power consumption is a pretty big advantage. it can potentially matter in large data centers as well since they usually could not care less about single CPU performance because they are just as happy adding more CPUs if it make economic sense and heat/power eventually become the limiting factor as you try to increase density.",2,0.525,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,the long term risk is RISC V,0,0.543,0.986,NEGATIVE

,,"I'll be the first to admit that I don't know enough about this to comment, but here I am commenting. Personally I own NVDA, AMD, and INTC. Mostly NVDA though.Mostly in INTC because they're so undervalued (IMO) but I def love AMD and NVDA. Def stuff I want to be holding in 5-10 yrs time.",0,0.544,0.999,POSITIVE
,,"It has been argued that as a result of the Trump administration's anti-competitive stance, selling to a US company will make ARM worth less than it is now, ultimately leaving a hole in the balance sheet Nvidia. There is a movement to actively move away from the US semiconductor industry. Any country outside of the US that develops a superior semiconductor will most probably cannibalize the US semiconductor industry to death.",0,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Nvidia almost 2 times the market cap of Intel. I had no idea it was that big.,0,0.581,0.543,POSITIVE
,,"Market cap's only half the story. For example:Intel's revenue is ~75billion, Nvidia ~12billionIntel's Profit is ~40billion, Nvidia ~6billionIntel has 110,000 employees, Nvidia has 13,000Nvidia's definitely growing to go much bigger than it is now, and quickly. Intel on the other hand will likely continue steady growth but AMD/Nvidia will eat into its overall marketshare. So in a few years I'd expect the entire market being bigger and all parties selling more, but AMD/Nvidia getting a much larger slice of the new pie than Intel.That said from a stock perspective AMD/Nvidia seem pretty expensive and Intel pretty cheap. My comment above is about actual sales and size not stock values.",1,0.596,0.986,NEGATIVE
