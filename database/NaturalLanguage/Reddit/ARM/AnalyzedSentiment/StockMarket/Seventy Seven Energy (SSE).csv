,"Back in 2011, I bought 100 shares of CHK. Kind of a dumb investment. It's largely, until recently, been to the downside since then, and all I've gotten from it is my $9 dividend each quarter. Anyway, the other day, I check my account and I now own 7 shares of something called ""Seventy-Seven Energy"". Symbol SSE and trading at this time at $26.70. And it's up nearly 20% since the shares were given to me Some base research shows that SSE is a spin off of CHK and it looks like SSE was the oilfield operations arm of CHK. I have two questions. Why was I given these shares? What recommendations does anyone have for what to do with it?","Hi There,Since the subsidiary Chesapeake Oilfield Services had value as an asset, and since that asset was no longer a part of CHK, your CHK stock price dropped a couple of dollars on July 1st when the divestiture was completed. However, as a shareholder, you don't simply lose that value. So, they issued you shares in SSE to compensate.As for what to do with them, totally up to you. Midstream competition is robust, however in their first few days of trading they're up 13%.",0,0.533,0.999,NEGATIVE
