,"0:00 / 0:31 SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has announced a massive $100 billion commitment to invest in the United States. The announcement was made during a meeting with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where Son described Trump as a “double-down president.” “This is double of last time, as President Trump said, because I say President Trump is a double-down president,” Son stated. In classic Trump fashion, he pushed for even more, telling Son: “Make it $200 billion.” Son reportedly laughed and responded: “I’ll try.” For context, SoftBank is known for its bold and sometimes controversial investments in tech, AI, and startups—everything from Uber to WeWork. While some of these moves have been hugely successful (like Arm), others have been… let’s say “experimental.” A $100 billion investment push into U.S. businesses could signal bullish momentum for certain sectors—tech, AI, startups, and infrastructure. If Son’s Vision Fund 2.0 delivers, this could be a big catalyst for growth in U.S.-based companies. What do you think? Is this good news for U.S. equities, or is SoftBank playing 4D chess with its capital again? Where would you expect this money to flow?",I don't get why people keep giving Son money to invest.,0,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.998
