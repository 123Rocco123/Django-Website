If you learn to use IBKR's UI you'll probably never use anything else in your life for long-term investing.If you name a broker I've probably tried it, from the typical ones like Schwab/TD Ameritrade to the shady ones that were stationed in the Caymans and later shut down by the SEC (Ustocktrade). I wasn't a big fan of Lightspeed because of their order execution speed. Centerpoint has decent execution speed and a special short locate program that I really like.",5,0.517,0.998,POSITIVE
,"I am a ex-prop trader working in US equities and these are the stocks on my watchlist (12/29). I don't expect much trading because the markets around the holiday season are usually pretty slow. No positions in any of these stocks unless noted otherwise. To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, or from 6:30 to 7, but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. FSR- (+11%) Gave an update of Q4 deliveries rising over 300% q/q. Low price stock, 600K Mkt cap and <$2. Decent volume, but not exceptional. Worth watching $2 breakout for failure. ELP- (-11%) No news (that I can find), sold off overnight from $10 ->$8.75. Possibly worth getting small size in for turn over few days. Brazilian, higher risk. EDU/HUYA/Chinese stocks- (+X%) Been seeing the bigger Chinese names have gains recently (same with YINN) for various reasons, HUYA was recently affected by the regulations on gaming by China. MARA/RIOT/other Bitcoin related stocks (+1%) Still worth watching for turn, since it trades fairly in-line with BTC likely going to experience reversal over the next few days (unless ETF is approved) EDIT: Something I realized: these Chinese education names might be moving up due to two reasons: EDU recently sold their educational arm, and China's crackdown on video gaming. Less time gaming means more time studying for the Chinese youth, sadly.","Ya just wondering because you use it like it qualifies you or something.I read it like this, Hi I used to be a prop trader,but I ultimately failed at it,so I’m coming to Reddit to impress you all with my credentials.",2,0.504,0.515,POSITIVE

I've actually been MORE successful outside the prop firm than in it, but that was mainly due to 2020. If we didn't have such a huge market move I'd probably have performed worse than if I had stayed.Happy new year!",3,0.559,0.978,NEGATIVE
