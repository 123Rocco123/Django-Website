,"The Semiconductor Sector has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing. In the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned. If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions. IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video Nvidia ~ $NVDA ""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel.

AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now.

You seem to have a good understanding of these companies what they do, how they make money, etc. And it is totally correct that AMD and NVDA will likely continue to grow at a faster rate than Intel, but I think it is very important to also consider the price you are paying for a stock. At the end of the day a good company can still be priced too high to buy into with any real margin of safety and in my opinion that is the case with both AMD and NVDA. Personally I like discounted free cashflow to determine fair value and if analyst's estimates for revenues over the next 5-10 years are even remotely accurate (which they usually are) AMD and NVDA both look to be trading at much higher prices than what I calculate their intrinsic values to be. Intel is around or a bit below its fair value depending on what numbers you use, but of course there are reasons it is being valued much lower than the other two.tldr; IMHO (strictly my humble opinion and in NO WAY financial advice): AMD and NVDA are trading too far above intrinsic value to be good buys, and of course even if Intel's stock price looks attractive if you do not like their business prospects for the coming years it may not be a good buy either so I guess I didn't really help you at all lol",0,0.558,0.997,NEGATIVE

The price right now is based on their earnings going down. So P/E 13 seems low, but if their earnings sink, pretty soon they'll be $53 and P/E 20.By using an outdated process, it's harder for them to compete without cutting price significantly, so they'll only be used where energy use and performance aren't critical.Apple wasn't a huge loss, but they were still 5% of processors. Amazon is starting to make their own server chips. Microsoft is doing the same. If they lose more market share to AMD, you can see how this is a death by 1000 cuts. The only way they stop those trends is by returning to be a market leader where their customers can get great performance without maintaining their own processor design department.The only reason all these fab-less makers have risen up (AMD / Apple / ARM) is because Intel was way too complacent. In a world where Intel is best, Apple doesn't make their own chip and AMD is seen as the budget brand. Intel never pursued the high end micro controller market like they should have, which is how ARM became the giant they are. So the new CEO has an opportunity. He's got name recognition and a mountain of cash. If the new fabs go well, they manufacture good GPU's using TSM and they can get to 3 nm feature sizing, they will be a player again. That's the plan, but now they need to execute.",3,0.551,0.999,NEGATIVE

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs.

The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.

Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

(AMD is TSMC's 2nd largest customer)Intel will create chips for their GPU in TSMC factories. I am not sure Intel even thought about it but having TSMC produce chips for their GPU reduces the amount of chips they can produce for Nvidia and AMD.At the same time Intel can continue producing their own chips for other things (they don't rely on them in CPU as opposed to AMD).TSMC is a major bottleneck for both of these companies while not so much for Intel. What good is quality when you can't build it. Just look at the shortage that Nvidia experienced after they launched their 3070.Intel is also opening a brand new market for themselves in the gaming GPU market with Alchemist rumored to be released Q1 (Laptop) and Q2 (Desktop) of 2022. On top of that Battlemage is rumored to remain with TSMC chips and to go down to 4/5nm chips.This is of course on top of them moving into vehicle chips and offering to produce much smaller chips for cars.My money is definitely on Intel long.Also, you might want to look into Analog Devices (ADI).

During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs.

Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity.

AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.

Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done.

Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs.

We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021. Q2 Earnings Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates. Crypto Market dependence When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs. For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell $400 million worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just $266 million. Future Growth In the Gaming Segment NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. Arm Deal Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it. Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance. IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech Q2 Earnings And Growth On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD website - q2 Financial results Video Games Potential Growth Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for Nintendo's Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022. Xilinx Acquisition AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly. Intel ~ $INTC Intel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%. Intel fell behind TSMC in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to AMD in PC and data center CPU markets. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL New CEO = New Future? Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia. If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again. GPUs War Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA or AMD. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. Personal note: Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.
