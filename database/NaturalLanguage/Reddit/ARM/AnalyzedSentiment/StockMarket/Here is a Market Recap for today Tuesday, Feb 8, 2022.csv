,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, February 8, 2022 Stocks reversed from yesterday to close higher, as market participants continue to digest corporate earning reports and look ahead to the release of the consumer price index, due Thursday. Notably, tech stocks and small caps rose despite the 10-year Treasury yield hitting 1.95%, the highest level in over two years. Markets Today S&P 500 (SPY): +0.82% Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.12% Dow Jones (DIA): +1.04% Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.71% Volatility Index (VIX): -6.21% Amazon (AMZN): +2.20% Chipotle (CMG): +6.50% after-hours Enphase Energy (ENPH): +15.75% Corsair Gaming (CRSR): -4.5% Peloton (PTON): +25% Lyft (LYFT): -6% NovaVax (NVAX): -11.92% Heading into this week, just over half of S&P 500 companies had reported actual quarterly earnings results. The expected growth rate for aggregate S&P 500 earnings stood at 29.2%, according to data from FactSet on Friday. If maintained for the next several weeks of the earnings season, this would mark the fourth straight quarter that earnings grow by more than 25%. So far, according to FactSet, companies in the S&P 500 are generating 12.4% net profits, higher than the pre-pandemic peak of 12.0 percent in the third quarter of 2018, though below Q1-Q3 2021’s range of 12.8-13.1%. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Advisors, said “What we’re seeing from here on is a more sustainable pace of growth. ou’ll still see consumers, which are very resilient backed up by excess savings, supply chain normalizations for a boost of inventories and production, and you have corporate balance sheets which are still very, very strong.” Looking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is due to release January’s consumer price index (CPI), a key metric to determine the next moves by the Fed to fight inflation. Consensus economists are expecting a rise of 7.2% year-over-year for January, the fastest rise since 1982. Such a result proves the US economy has recovered enough from the pandemic-induced recession and is now running too hot. This would warrant an aggressive pivot by the Fed, which has already indicated it expects to raise interest rates in March. Highlights Peloton (PTON) stock surged after the company reported earnings and disclosed the CEO was stepping down and it was laying off roughly 2,800 employees. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is weighing the potential purchase of cybersecurity research and incident response company Mandiant Inc. (MNDT), Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the discussions. Shares of Pfizer (PFE) fell after the company missed earnings estimates and projected lower sales for 2022 than originally expected. Aluminum prices hit their highest level since 2008, closing in on a record, according to Bloomberg data. Australia's Mineral Resources Ltd. said it has signed a non-binding letter agreement with Albemarle Corp. to look at changes to, and ways to expand, the mining companies' partnership. After the failed NVIDIA acquisition, Softbank announced it was planning to list Arm on the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify (SPOT) has fallen right back to IPO prices four years after listing on the market. Swedish price comparison firm PriceRunner is suing Google for roughly $2.4 billion alleging anti-competitive practices. PriceRunner CEO Mikael Lindahl said, “They are still abusing the market to a very high extent and haven’t changed basically anything.” European regulators are calling for increased regulation in digital finances.
