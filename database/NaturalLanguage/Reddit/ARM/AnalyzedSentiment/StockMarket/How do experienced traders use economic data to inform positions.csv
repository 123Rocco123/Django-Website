,"Hello r/stockmarket! I approach you as one of the largest trading subreddits in the hopes of picking the brains of seasoned and creative traders alike about how they like to use economic data (like non-form payrolls) to position themselves advantageously in the market. Below I have shared how I like to leverage this data, and I hope you will share a bite of your experience with me. Because the day you stop learning is the day you start dying, am I right? So here's my contribution: Most traders know all about the effect of Fed news on price action whether that is with data drops like CPI, PPI, housing sales, or something else. But that's a common place for traders to end their relationship with economic data- Papa Powell just means volatility. But what if you could take advantage of the various data to inform your trading? You see, each set of data reveals new details into the story of the economy and we can use this data as traders to position ourselves in an advantageous way, enjoying longer trends and resistance to pulldowns (with thanks to staying power). The Market is a River You Endure Imagine someone who enjoys white-water rafting. This is someone who sits on a raft and uses their paddle to influence their direction as they make their way down a river. White-water rafting is pretty simple, really, but that doesn't mean it's always easy. In fact there are six class of white water, each one more dangerous than the next. Class 1 and 2 are for floating and soaking in nature while Class 4 is an aggressive adventure (and Class 6 represents extreme danger, taking the lives of some of the most experienced athletes). And here's the thing: Regardless of the class of white-water, the rafter always has the same paddle. But that paddle doesn't influence their direction as much with more aggressive waters. The more difficult the water the more strategy, planning, experience, and fitness are required to traverse the river. Sound familiar? Strategy... Planning... Experience... Fitness (Capital) The Problem Now back to trading: We've all heard the statistic: 95% of traders don't prosper long term. There's lots of reasons why this might have some merit, but one of them is traders not fully understanding the market in which they paddle. The river is going to take you where it wants. You can only maneuver between the rocks. Imagine not knowing which class of water you're about to carve through? Class 6 will rip your arms off. And I'm telling you right now that this right here is a good analogy for a trader who completely ignores economic catalysts and overall trends. Traders like you and me can benefit from understanding which ""class"" of market they are in. There are times when volatility is low and times where it is high. Even worse, there are times when volatility is *impending* and traders don't know what is going to happen. Which brings us to the point of this post: Economic Data Drops: How to Take Advantage Let's start with some data that is applicable today. Non-farm Payrolls and Unemployment data comes out tomorrow (September 2nd, 2022). This represents one of the most important pieces of economic data. Period. This happens every first-Friday of the month. I'd argue it is even more important during this season of inflation and supply issues. I'm going to use a lot of super great explanations from Graeme Watkins, CEO of Valutrades Limited (of which I have no affiliation), to illustrate how day traders can benefit from digesting this kind of information. What advantages does Non-Farm Payroll data offer traders? Advantage #1: Find Volume and Volatility Just knowing the date of these drops helps identify volume and volatility shifts. After the report hits tomorrow before open, you'll notice a rise in market activity. Having a handy economic calendar for significant news helps traders game plan for a high volatility environment. We've all been there. You do your research. You have a plan. You're ready to go... And then... ""Wtf was that?! You seeing this volume?!"" That never actually goes away completely (lol, life) but you can prevent surprises and game plan differently by knowing when these data drops occur. I love this app for economic calendar (again, no affiliation). https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921 Advantage #2: Find Momentum Sectors and Hot Stocks Early Most traders are late to a trend and find just a fraction of a run to take advantage of, missing a huge chunk of the whole move. What if you could capture the lion's share of it instead of a tiny slice? Well, traders can identify momentum sectors and hot stocks early with thanks to a (somewhat) predictable market rotation from NFP data. And of course momentum can present clean trends for larger profits and safety against pullbacks. How? Well, to be overly simple, changing rates affect business decisions, manufacturing, and distribution. These changes in business operations have a butterfly affect of sorts that represent headwinds and tailwinds for affiliated industries. This is provided by the guts of the NFP data which is that that we get to learn about the ""total number of paid U.S. workers of any registered business; exclusions to this figure include private household employees, employees of nonprofit organizations, general government employees, and—as you can probably already gather—farm employees."" Notable tickers to watch during the data drop: DXY, USD/EUR, VIX. If you noticed my username, you might know me for my recent contributions to Reddit via market rotation reports. They're fueled more by macroeconomics and fundamentals, but are still in tune with data drops such as NFP. Here is a link to the most recent one as an example of how markets rotate and money flows according to various stimuli. https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/x1gt8q/tracking_subsectors_this_week_chemicals_oil_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 (Mods, if this r/daytrading link is going to be evaluated as self-promotion, please let me know. I am happy to remove this link for the health of the subreddit. I do not commercially self-promote on public subreddits.) Advantage #3: Leverage Group-think Self-Fulfilling Prophecies We all know trading is a psychological jungle. Wouldn't it be nice to have a bead on the general sentiment in the market? Being aware of current trends and ""group-think"" offers an enormous edge. Take advantage of the psychological aspect of the market. Because you see... ""When jobs are increasing in number, sentiment within the market generates momentum, with consumers having more disposable income and, thus, spending more... An increase in user spending has always been a factor behind USD performance, even if its impact is often understated."" Side note: With this quoted, it should be known that right now good news is bad news since the labor market and spending is part of the reason inflation is still white hot. But that's another chat for another time, one that I am sure would be an energetic conversation. When traders are aware of shifts in sentiment or socially trending topics, they can find where volume and volatility are, representing opportunities for profit. And if they understand the data, they can make smart choices on their strategies as it relates to direction and risk/reward evaluations. Tracking Social Sentiment Manually There are cool websites that track keyword mentions across the internet. Watch how the words ""unemployment, inflation, and recession"" spike after the data drop tomorrow. I like this one (no affiliation): https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession What about you? These are just a few quick ways that I feel traders can benefit from watching and digesting financial data. If you'd like to learn more about the impacts of financial data like this, I have some resources I'm happy to share, but I'd like to hear from everyone else. Tell us your magic sauce.

What is showing you is the buying and selling behavior of the people that are moving the markets. There is no one indicator I use but I will try various ones on whatever asset I might be looking at trading or accumulating or even distributing. They actually work better in crypto where a lot of chart painting takes place and you can start figuring out where people are likely to be putting on positions to trade against them,1,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE
