,The requirements from IB are pretty substantial when compared to some of the US platforms such as Tradovate and Ninjatrader. Does anyone know if Canada has any micro future platforms available that don’t request an arm and a leg?,What requirements concern you?,0,0.502,0.8,NEGATIVE
,The requirements from IB are pretty substantial when compared to some of the US platforms such as Tradovate and Ninjatrader. Does anyone know if Canada has any micro future platforms available that don’t request an arm and a leg?,"Minimum 10k to start. I have a 1k that i would like to try with, brokerages like ninja have $400 minimum requirements. I have been paper trading successfully for a month and really want to give micros a go with real money.",1,0.514,0.547,NEGATIVE
,The requirements from IB are pretty substantial when compared to some of the US platforms such as Tradovate and Ninjatrader. Does anyone know if Canada has any micro future platforms available that don’t request an arm and a leg?,Yeah I think you’re out of luck. Options are super limited and 10K really isn’t a high bar. I know Optimus Futures and Lightspeed accept Canadians but their minimums are 100K and 25K.,2,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE
,The requirements from IB are pretty substantial when compared to some of the US platforms such as Tradovate and Ninjatrader. Does anyone know if Canada has any micro future platforms available that don’t request an arm and a leg?,I really don’t understand it. Micros we’re invented to give access and take away some risk. But Canadian brokers are not focused on these. If someone could open up a micros brokerage for Canadians with reasonable minimums and reasonable fees I think it would be a goldmine. Nothing exists like that,3,0.504,1.0,NEGATIVE
,The requirements from IB are pretty substantial when compared to some of the US platforms such as Tradovate and Ninjatrader. Does anyone know if Canada has any micro future platforms available that don’t request an arm and a leg?,The Canadian market is super small and dominated by the big 5. Anyone who wants to trade futures would just open an account at IB. The number of people who want to trade futures and don’t have 10K in Canada can probably be counted on one hand.,4,0.519,0.993,NEGATIVE
