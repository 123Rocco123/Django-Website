,Look at the financial reports for GM. Unit sales are way down for 2020 and forecast for 2021 has been reduced. They are taking a lot of their expense for EV and placing it on the balance sheet instead of expensing it. This increases net income and hides an expense. 1/3 of their income comes from their finance arm. GM results are not the best for 2020 and do not justify the price. A price around 40 is more appropriate especially when they are plowing billions into an unproven market. Total EV vehicles have performance issues and a hybrid with a small engine to recharge the batteries is a better approach. See Page 21 of presentation report for how they hide the EV cost. https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gm-reports-strong-2020-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-results,"1/3 of their income comes from their finance armAs I understand it, this is true of most American auto manufacturers and when you look at what is going on in auto lending (more people borrowing more than they can afford) you have to wonder what will happen to the stock price of these companies when the chickens come home to roost.",0,0.53,0.98,POSITIVE

I reviewed your post history and it seems you are not really clear on what EV as a technology means for vehicles. Additionally, the largest cost to EV is the batteries. Better battery tech is coming and isn’t exclusive to cars. E-bikes also use a similar technology.",0,0.536,0.998,NEGATIVE

Do your own research, don't rely on someone else. The EV's battery does not perform well when real hot or real cold. The battery does not get the range when you are hauling a load. If you drive 40 miles a day, this is not a big deal. If you drive 100 miles a day, it is a big deal. Plus look at all of the high density housing with no dedicated parking. Musk is already paying out more for charges in Texas due to the electric auction. Charging will not be free down the road as this will cost money to generate the electricity.I think EV is a good way to go, but it is not going to replace ICE by 2035. Plus going EV just keeps the automakers in the game, it does not increase profits.https://www.wired.com/story/electric-cars-cold-weather-tips/https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrids-evs/buying-an-electric-car-for-a-cold-climate-double-down-on-range/",1,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

I do not have a position in Hyundai Motors, but I honestly think they are positioned to show the most growth this year based on inventory levels and increasing market share (despite the apple deal falling through).",0,0.569,0.814,POSITIVE
