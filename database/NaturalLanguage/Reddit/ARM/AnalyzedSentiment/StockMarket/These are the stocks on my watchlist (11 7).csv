,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Why isn’t ___ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News: Powell Faces New Outlooks On Fed Rate Cuts After Trump’s US Election Win Airport Security Firm Clear Plunges On Slowing Member Growth Overall, watching the same stocks as yesterday. DJT - Currently short but watching for some kind of bounce today, TSLA - Watching $300 level and $290 level. Short biased, but no position in this- it's possible we'll make another leg up in this. ARM - Reported earnings in line with expectation, shares dropped mainly due to no raised guidance. EPS of $0.30 vs $0.26, Revenue of $855M vs $808M. SMCI - News from last week: auditor resigns. Fears of this being delisted and upcoming earnings are leading to big selloff, lowest it’s been in the past few months. Missed their earnings report two days ago... so likely going to be delisted. PACS - Short report by Hindenburg 3 days ago, another massive selloff. Just watching at the moment, no bias. Another insane selloff yesterday with no bounce at all. GOOG - Interested in this as a longer-term investment, Pres #47 will likely fire Lina Khan which will stop the FTC case against GOOG. Currently long. Earnings: DKNG, SQ, RIVN, U, PINS, ABNB","I like that you are listing if you are short, bullish, short-biased, etc; I think it provides a lot of context into the Winning Watchlist.

NASDAQ typically issues a warning, giving the company 180 calendar days to regain compliance by trading at or above $1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days.Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (MVPHS): A stock may be delisted if it does not maintain a minimum market value of publicly held shares (typically at least $1 million for NASDAQ Capital Market or higher for other tiers) for 30 consecutive business days. Companies often have a similar grace period to correct this.Shareholders’ Equity: NASDAQ requires companies to maintain certain shareholders’ equity thresholds, depending on the market tier (e.g., $2.5 million for the Capital Market). Falling below these thresholds can lead to delisting.Total Market Value: Companies are required to maintain a minimum total market value, which varies by market tier, but it generally ranges from $35 million to $110 million. Failure to meet this for 30 consecutive days triggers a compliance period for correction.Reporting Requirements: Companies must file timely financial statements with the SEC. Failing to file can result in immediate delisting.Other Requirements: Companies must have a certain number of shareholders (at least 300 for NASDAQ Capital Market), meet corporate governance standards, and maintain a minimum bid price and trading volume.Financial Distress: If a company declares bankruptcy, it can lead to immediate delisting.Voluntary Delisting: Companies may choose to delist themselves, usually after a merger, acquisition, or if they want to go private.This is copy/pasted from ChatGPTLikely that since they’re failing to report earnings, they’ll be delisted out of the blue.Getting delisted is a death sentence for the stock price- generally market makers stay out of the stock so the trading gets REALLY thin.",1,0.566,NEGATIVE,1.0
