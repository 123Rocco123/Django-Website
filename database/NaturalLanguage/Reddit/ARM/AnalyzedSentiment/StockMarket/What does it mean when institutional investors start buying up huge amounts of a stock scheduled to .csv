,"So there's this conglomerate in my country that has an energy arm. It's already built alot of plants here and abroad. Recently they acquired a smaller public company from the same sector. A few months ago there were rumors that it's gonna be their energy arm's back door, then a few days ago they've formally announced the name and symbol change on the exchange. Few days later that institutions such as Deutsche Bank and another local institution started to buy HUGE amounts of the stock (like 30 million in value that day) and even more today. What exactly does this mean? For the record I've also bought the stock for way lower than the instis bought. Have I struck gold?","Just because some company/bank invests in the stock doesn't necessarily mean its about to go up even more, just that one bank making a gamble on this company. If you want to take in profits, you should if you don't feel like the company is overvalued now, carry on holding. ""Struck gold"" would suggest you should sellout and dip before others will. Just the fact the company had to do a backdoor listing aka they couldn't legally meet the requirements for a regular listing / ipo would raise concerns",0,0.585,1.0,NEGATIVE
