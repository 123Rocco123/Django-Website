,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020 Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe. After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up. On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result, it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years. Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.” On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly. The US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks. Highlights Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it’s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC). Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk. Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader! Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles’ Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles’ Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single’s day is a counter to Valentine’s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it’s held on Nov 11. This is the world’s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles’ Day last year. Amazon’s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year. Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, a major indicator for China's manufacturing sector, rose in October, showing that domestic demand is holding up, reports said over the weekend.

After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.” On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000.

This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020 Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe. After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up. On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result, it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016.

The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020 Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe. After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up. On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result, it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years. Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.” On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000.
