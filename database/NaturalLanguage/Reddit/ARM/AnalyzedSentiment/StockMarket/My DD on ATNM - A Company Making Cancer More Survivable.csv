,"Intro What is $ATNM and why do I like it? According to it's about page, Actinium Pharmaceuticals is ""... a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing ARC’s or Antibody Radiation-Conjugates, which combine the targeting ability of antibodies with the cell killing ability of radiation. "" They're currently in a pivotal Phase 3 trial for their new drug Iomab-B that condition's elders with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia for life saving bone marrow transplants. I think Actinium has a product with promise and it's at a reasonable price for a long-term speculative play. Disclaimer This is not financial advice. I'm just a random guy on the internet. Always do your own due diligence. The Product with Potential What separates $ATNM from other pharmaceutical companies is their cancer-targeting technology. They call it their Antibody Warhead Enabling (AWE) platform because they ""exploit the use of highly selective targeted biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies that can seek out and bind cancer antigens found on the tumor cell surface."" Which basically means they modify antibodies with the ability to deliver tumor destroying radiation (the ""warhead"") directly to the cancer cells. This is in contrast to general chemotherapy that irradiates healthy cells in the process of irradiating cancer cells. The ability to specifically target cancer cells opens the door to life saving treatments for elders who can't endure traditional chemotherapy. If that sounds too good to be true, then check out the data collected from their ongoing trials. With only 75% enrollment to their Phase 3 trials in December 2020, Yahoo Finance reported on positive results with patients already enrolled. The article goes into detail about the trials, stating ""100% (49/49) of patients receiving a therapeutic dose of Iomab-B in SIERRA have successfully proceeded to Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) compared to 16% (9/56) of patients in the control arm who received physician's choice of salvage therapies... Of the 84% (47/56) of patients that did not achieve complete remission on the control arm, 64% (30/47) of patients crossed over to receive Iomab-B with 100% (30/30) of those patients successfully proceeding to BMT."" They provide a helpful chart to help visualize this. Remember, Iomab-B isn't the cure for cancer, it's the means of conditioning elders to be able to receive bone marrow transplants. It's the bone marrow transplants that save lives, and using Iomab-B significantly increases survivorship. Their page on Iomab-B shows increased survival rates from ~10% in year one to 30% survival in year one and 0% survival in year two to 19% survival in year two. Additionally, Iomab-B lets patients receive bone marrow transplants 12 days after therapy compared to 42 days with chemotherapy according to the chart they provide. I'm not a doctor, but an increased survival rate of ~20% for year one and two independently seems significant considering the current survival rates. In my opinion, the results from the study point to a new, more accessible cancer therapy that looks prime to be approved by the FDA at the end of Phase 3. The Company When buying stocks, it's important to remember that you're buying portions of a company in hopes that they can use your cash to generate more profits for you later down the line. The ability for a company to do that is hinged on a few factors, the first factor being the company management. $ATNM provides us with a page of their executive team which includes all of the people who make the company run. The CEO Sandesh Seth seems capable of the position with 25+ years in investment banking, equity research, and most importantly, the pharma industry (to include working for Pfizer [who's currently rolling out Covid vaccines]). He even has several patents related to radiopharmaceuticals. Of course, the doctors on staff at $ATNM are equally as important to take into consideration when developing new drugs. The Scientific Advisory Board (for Iomab-B) is made up of experts in their field from Cancer Centers all over the country; It's worth viewing their extensive credentials. Another important factor in determining a company's value is their financial statements. I've had some struggle with valuing $ATNM because their financial statements are not like the ones I'm accustomed to reading. Meaning, I don't have much experience knowing if a clinical-trial pharmaceutical company's financials are good or not, but I did my best with what I know. For starters, I looked into the company's ability to pay back its debt, because a company with large, unexplainable debts is a red flag for me. In the case of $ATNM, I noticed that their Quick and Current Ratio were very good (at 1.74 and 1.89 respectively). This means that they have enough assets to pay off well over 100% of the short-term debt they owe. Having learned this, I looked into their assets and liabilities to discover that their current assets, which are mostly in cash and short-term investments, have been steadily draining at a rate of ~$5million annually. This is due to high operating expenses that are mostly in the research and development of their new drugs. I assume that they will simply leverage their low debt to borrow capital if needed. Additionally, although net income and earnings per share are negative, they've been increasing year over year from 2018 and 2015 respectively. I think EPS is going to be positive in the short term if it continues its trend. I used stockrow.com to get financials. The Valuation So what's $ATNM worth? How much money can you make? Yahoo Finance estimates that $ATNM will hit a price target of $38.74 in one year with a low of $25 and high of $65. I take it with a grain of salt. All I know is that I think the cancer treatment they're developing is outstanding enough to separate it from other treatments already available for AML. The data from their research has earned my confidence in the treatment and I think buying and holding $ATNM long will be rewarding. This is speculative though, so I would only put in money you can afford to lose. I hope this was helpful!",I bought 200 shares some years ago at 2$ and 200 more when it decreased at 1$.

The Scientific Advisory Board (for Iomab-B) is made up of experts in their field from Cancer Centers all over the country; It's worth viewing their extensive credentials. Another important factor in determining a company's value is their financial statements. I've had some struggle with valuing $ATNM because their financial statements are not like the ones I'm accustomed to reading. Meaning, I don't have much experience knowing if a clinical-trial pharmaceutical company's financials are good or not, but I did my best with what I know. For starters, I looked into the company's ability to pay back its debt, because a company with large, unexplainable debts is a red flag for me. In the case of $ATNM, I noticed that their Quick and Current Ratio were very good (at 1.74 and 1.89 respectively). This means that they have enough assets to pay off well over 100% of the short-term debt they owe. Having learned this, I looked into their assets and liabilities to discover that their current assets, which are mostly in cash and short-term investments, have been steadily draining at a rate of ~$5million annually. This is due to high operating expenses that are mostly in the research and development of their new drugs. I assume that they will simply leverage their low debt to borrow capital if needed. Additionally, although net income and earnings per share are negative, they've been increasing year over year from 2018 and 2015 respectively.

Yahoo Finance estimates that $ATNM will hit a price target of $38.74 in one year with a low of $25 and high of $65. I take it with a grain of salt. All I know is that I think the cancer treatment they're developing is outstanding enough to separate it from other treatments already available for AML.

,"Intro What is $ATNM and why do I like it? According to it's about page, Actinium Pharmaceuticals is ""... a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing ARC’s or Antibody Radiation-Conjugates, which combine the targeting ability of antibodies with the cell killing ability of radiation. "" They're currently in a pivotal Phase 3 trial for their new drug Iomab-B that condition's elders with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia for life saving bone marrow transplants. I think Actinium has a product with promise and it's at a reasonable price for a long-term speculative play. Disclaimer This is not financial advice. I'm just a random guy on the internet. Always do your own due diligence. The Product with Potential What separates $ATNM from other pharmaceutical companies is their cancer-targeting technology. They call it their Antibody Warhead Enabling (AWE) platform because they ""exploit the use of highly selective targeted biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies that can seek out and bind cancer antigens found on the tumor cell surface."" Which basically means they modify antibodies with the ability to deliver tumor destroying radiation (the ""warhead"") directly to the cancer cells. This is in contrast to general chemotherapy that irradiates healthy cells in the process of irradiating cancer cells. The ability to specifically target cancer cells opens the door to life saving treatments for elders who can't endure traditional chemotherapy. If that sounds too good to be true, then check out the data collected from their ongoing trials. With only 75% enrollment to their Phase 3 trials in December 2020, Yahoo Finance reported on positive results with patients already enrolled. The article goes into detail about the trials, stating ""100% (49/49) of patients receiving a therapeutic dose of Iomab-B in SIERRA have successfully proceeded to Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) compared to 16% (9/56) of patients in the control arm who received physician's choice of salvage therapies... Of the 84% (47/56) of patients that did not achieve complete remission on the control arm, 64% (30/47) of patients crossed over to receive Iomab-B with 100% (30/30) of those patients successfully proceeding to BMT."" They provide a helpful chart to help visualize this. Remember, Iomab-B isn't the cure for cancer, it's the means of conditioning elders to be able to receive bone marrow transplants. It's the bone marrow transplants that save lives, and using Iomab-B significantly increases survivorship. Their page on Iomab-B shows increased survival rates from ~10% in year one to 30% survival in year one and 0% survival in year two to 19% survival in year two. Additionally, Iomab-B lets patients receive bone marrow transplants 12 days after therapy compared to 42 days with chemotherapy according to the chart they provide. I'm not a doctor, but an increased survival rate of ~20% for year one and two independently seems significant considering the current survival rates.
