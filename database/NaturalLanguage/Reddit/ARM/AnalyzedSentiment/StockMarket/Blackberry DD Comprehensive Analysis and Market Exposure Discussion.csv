Message me directly for the link if you’re interested. I included figure legends for some reference. If you’re reading this post, then you probably haven’t given your boss the middle finger and retired yourself on your new private island funded by the gains from the Gamestop (wallstreetbets) crusade against the MM’s. I missed that train after having unloaded my $5,000 leap calls position on GME back in November - but gains come and go. I’ve already made a post on why I believe Shift is a great investment both in the short term and long term, so if you’re interested, you can check out my post history for more on that. This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017.

John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

I’ve already made a post on why I believe Shift is a great investment both in the short term and long term, so if you’re interested, you can check out my post history for more on that. This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology.

These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection.

This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017.

One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

I missed that train after having unloaded my $5,000 leap calls position on GME back in November - but gains come and go. I’ve already made a post on why I believe Shift is a great investment both in the short term and long term, so if you’re interested, you can check out my post history for more on that. This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology.

These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

A big concern with BB in automotive is the eco-system leverage Apple, Amazon or Google/Android bring in that space. Most users (IMO) given a choice would prefer an OS in their cars that seamlessly connect with the rest of their tech ecosystem e.g. iPhone, app store apps, etc.. A secure OS is now table stakes and if it doesn't come with apps like Maps, Spotify, Waze, etc.. will struggle for adoption in the long run. How does BB stack on that front??",0,0.511,0.866,POSITIVE

I missed that train after having unloaded my $5,000 leap calls position on GME back in November - but gains come and go. I’ve already made a post on why I believe Shift is a great investment both in the short term and long term, so if you’re interested, you can check out my post history for more on that. This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection.

If you’re reading this post, then you probably haven’t given your boss the middle finger and retired yourself on your new private island funded by the gains from the Gamestop (wallstreetbets) crusade against the MM’s. I missed that train after having unloaded my $5,000 leap calls position on GME back in November - but gains come and go. I’ve already made a post on why I believe Shift is a great investment both in the short term and long term, so if you’re interested, you can check out my post history for more on that. This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars.

Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.). The potential finds its way into uncharted territories as even bonafide manufacturers like GM, Ford, VW are all QXN customers making a quick transition towards full EV. This not only bolsters the potential reach of QXN technology, but makes it more desirable as an OS to compete against none other than Tesla at this moment. The $3-$5 per unit vehicle for QXN technology may be revisited and increased by multiple folds. Now, taking our eyes off the bread n’ butter QXN OS technology, let me introduce to you Blackberry’s rather new Spark Suite cyber security technology. John Chen puts the demand for the product best in his 2019 interview, explaining that the digital transformation across businesses around the world creates target points for cyber criminals to breach into sensitive data and the increased volume of IoT endpoints, Spark Suites provides a consolidated and simplified security software to prevent these attacks. One such customer is Australia’s largest payment processing company, BPAY, similar to that of Paypal, which employs Spark Suite to manage all of its endpoint security. See below for a sample of Blackberry Spark Suite’s interphase: Figure 6: An overview of the interactive layer screen for Blackberry Spark Suite’s technology, showing a simplified but consolidated security system to protect companies all around the world from cyber attacks and data breaches. Spark Suite Description Direct from Blackberry’s Page: “UES: AI-Enabled Security Across All Endpoints BlackBerry Spark is built to enable a Zero Trust security environment, focused on protection across any endpoint and continuously validating that trust at every event or transaction. By validating user actions, it continuously authenticates users to deliver a Zero Touch experience that improves security with no user interruption. UEM: Advanced Device and Application Management Your network is expanding with more endpoints than ever before. With a combination of security innovation, management tools, platform stability, deep experience across operational environments, and enhanced productivity applications, BlackBerry Spark Suites deliver the right capabilities to support your endpoint management and workforce productivity needs.” For additional reference, the global endpoint security market size is expected to grow from USD 12.8 billion in 2019 to USD 18.4 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This figure, which was assessed in 2019, is subject to change more towards an undervaluation than not. Global endpoint security is the backbone of essentially all tech-based companies because sensitive data, field-collected data, and internal data are all vital and confidential information. Of course, there are major competitors in this space as well, but with Blackberry having a mover’s advantage and the longest list of patented technology, they are going to be a dominant force and a recognizable name for potential partners. Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

I missed that train after having unloaded my $5,000 leap calls position on GME back in November - but gains come and go. I’ve already made a post on why I believe Shift is a great investment both in the short term and long term, so if you’re interested, you can check out my post history for more on that. This time around, I’ve got my eyes set on BB. I’ve started a position in September (before the WSB hype-train began) and I’m here to share my findings as comprehensively and analytically as possible. At this time, I do not believe BB is assessed properly and it’s valuation has astronomical potential if the cards are played correctly by BB management. First and foremost, I owned a Blackberry ages ago when it was actually cool to have one of those keyboard on screen devices. It was a flex-phone for sure and people loved it for some time. From 2009-2012, Blackberry was on top of the smartphone world having created an aesthetically pleasing device, both functional and practical for professionals to get their day-to-day tasks done on the phone. In the midst of this smartphone revolution, Apple had already released its iPhone in 2007, and garnered attention from the tech world for its design, accessibility, and the branding. Between 2010 and 2012, Apple iPhone sales jumped nearly 400% from 39.99M units to 125.05M - the rest was history. At around the same time, other smartphone manufacturers upped their antics with new technology (Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, etc), ultimately overshadowing the classic Blackberry devices that were once so loved. Fast forward to 2013, current CEO John Chen was appointed to make a difference at Blackberry, which by then had reduced revenue by 50% since 2011. Their CEO made a swift move to downsize the company from smartphone designer/manufacturer to a more diversified, stable, and less competitive market (at the time). By 2014, just less than one year under Chen’s leadership, Blackberry quietly transitioned into the cybersecurity software space, building OS platforms to ensure the safety and encryption of data for automobile companies like VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes, among others. This OS platform, known as QNX, is responsible for delivering advanced driver assistance, controlling digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules, as well as support hands free communication technology and infotainment in your beloved cars. Fun fact, QNX was originally imbedded into Blackberry's tablet devices, and was later acquired in 2010 by Blackberry from Harman International for $200M. Figure 1: Blackberry QNX/Spark sales progression 2016-2020 demonstrates consistent growth and sales margins are beginning to reach near 90% levels, suggesting lower overhead costs associated with maintaining and improving the software. The QNX OS is now used in over 175 million vehicles worldwide! In 2017, Blackberry reported that the QNX software is sold at a $3-5 per unit vehicle, which amounts to roughly $700M in revenue from QNX between 2010-2017. This isn’t a substantial figure, but within the last 3-4 years, the EV automotive industry has grown exponentially (see figure below), and the increased reliance of technology and data in cars creates an enormous demand for software and cybersecurity. Data encryption is extremely valuable, and Blackberry is waiting at the gate with all arms wide open to capture this market. This demand will not only increase the flux of QNX sales but may also give Blackberry leverage to increase the cost per unit vehicle of this technology. Figure 2: EV sales from 2008-2018, representing a 3.5% growth in the total market share of the automotive industry. Figure 3&4: Supporting EV market demand and EV cybersecurity demand correlation, both figures overlay perfectly to show that the growth in the EV space inevitably creates an appreciation from cybersecurity. Ensuring the safety of driver data is incredibly important and essential for companies to build roadmaps and products that best serve the consumers. Expected automotive cybersecurity market growth is at 18.5% CAGR! So the big question is competition. Why can’t Blackberry competitors (like Apple, Argus, Herman, Centri, Arxan, etc.) just crush Blackberry? Keep in mind that BlackBerry is already integrated with some of the largest automakers in the world, and there hasn’t been any major issues, data breaches, or anything especially faulty with QNX. Car manufacturers will avoid the cost of integrating new or alternative technologies into their vehicles if QNX poses insignificant issues. The time to develop another partnership, pairing new OS systems, and marketing would not make sense for an already frail industry with low margins. Moreover, a history into the OS performance shows that QNX sets a benchmark for reliability and diverse functionality: Figure 5: QNX wide range application in a typical vehicle. QNX is fully equipped in the infotainment, instrumental clusters, Hypervisor Safety system, and OTA software update instruments. Note, brands that have already integrated QXN technology are also making shifts towards fully EV vehicles, among this, are other emerging EV companies tapping into this space (i.e. Xpeng, Ronovo, Damon Motorcycle, BYD, etc.).

Here is a comprehensive list of products offered by Blackberry: Figure 7: Blackberry product offerings include endpoint security, personal and enterprise communication security, alerts and crisis communication services, endpoint management, mobile and digital applications for personal and workplace uses, transportation, QXN embedded technology and software, and antivirus for consumer protection. The collective global market size enjoyed by Blackberry at this time is broken down roughly on the below: Automotive cyber security 1.15B - 1.35B (Projected 7.8B by 2030) Global cyber security 112.1B Communication security 11.1B Endpoint Management 25.9B Estimated Total (Underestimation) 150-155B This is a very rough, but under-evaluation of Blackberry’s market exposure, as I did not incorporate the more niche products and services markets offered by Blackberry. I also avoided including the 39,000 patents which I have no way to quantify the actual value. These patents, however, are a major part of the future roadmap to Blackberry’s continued success and growth as they are segways into partnerships and licensing deals (particularly in the security and smartphone space). But back to the market share. At a modest 5% average market share across all the board in the future, the annual revenue can reach $7.5B. This is of course current numbers, with project market sizes subject to significant increases with the digital transformation rippling across the globe. At a fair 8x earnings multiple, I anticipate Blackberry to reach $144 per share in the future (~2-3 years if fast). In 2021, if all goes well (pandemic wanes, EV boom, cybersecurity security demands increase), I value Blackberry at $30-32 per share. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Purely educational.

We’re all here just trying to be able to make great investments for financial stability. Would love to share and learn more about different stocks with great potential. If BB does reach the $30 price target, I’ll be giving back to those that I see with smaller accounts.",3,0.528,0.922,NEGATIVE
