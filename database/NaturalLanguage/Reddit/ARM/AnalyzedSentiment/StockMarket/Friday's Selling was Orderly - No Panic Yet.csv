,,Almost like it was induced by algos to make a huge profit? Nah. The SEC would never allow that kind of chicanery to happen.,0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Well, the whole point of being in the markets is to make a profit. Algos (and their masters) are doing what they are paid to do.",1,0.548,0.737,NEGATIVE

,,"Isn’t there a whole other point of the market, something about promoting growth of good companies. Providing capital to good companies in exchange for profitable returns. The ideal myth of the market is that it supports the economic growth. Seems this isn’t reality, but I don’t think we should just accept the current casino.",2,0.554,0.986,NEGATIVE
,,"It's only a ""casino"" if you are day-trading. Long term, the value of stock is going to go up or down based on how valuable the company is.Also, I don't think buying stocks has anything to do with ""promoting"" ""good"" companies. For one, the vast majority of the time, you are buying a share that was created a long time ago. So the company sees no money from that. Investing is about finding the best return for your dollar - that's it.",3,0.603,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"If the market cap goes up the value of the company goes up which brings with it many financial advantages for the company (promoting growth). Buying a stock supports the company there is no question about that. Also, I didn’t say promoting a company, I said promoting growth of a company. If you’re gonna pick apart individual words in a comment at least get them right! Also you’re talking about just one part of the market, investors. I’m talking about the market as a whole including the companies, financial firms, and banks In response to the comment above about Algo trading and the “whole point” of the market. Maybe he means the whole point for the individual investor and then maybe it’s kind of true in a very narrow way. However accepting this perspective broadly and allowing contemporary mechanisms for trading kind of fucks up the economy and steels from retail, companies, and all stakeholders and in turn hurts that hypothetical individual investor who is there for a profit.",4,0.588,1.0,NEGATIVE
