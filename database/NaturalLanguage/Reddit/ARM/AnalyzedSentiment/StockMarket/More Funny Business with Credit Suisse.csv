,"In the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, the Swiss government marked down senior bonds as a loss, meaning those bonds went to zero. The shares in Credit Suisse have not been canceled, meaning the shareholders will be doing better than bondholders. The merger deal also skipped shareholder votes as emergency powers were used. It's not a coincidence the biggest shareholder is the Saudi government. Or should I say the House of Saud, as they are an absolute monarchy and government fund's are the sovereign's personal funds. They bought up 9.9% of shares on the way down, saying the shares were a steal since the company had more assets outstanding than their whole market cap. They stopped short of 10% as doing so would trigger the EU's regulatory restrictions, requiring fund managers to submit to background checks, audits, and reporting requirements. The Saudis did not just say they were unable at the moment to buy more they said they emphatically said they would ""absolutely not"" give Credit Suisse more funding, and this is what triggered the bank run. Many of you have heard that before but... I think I know why the Saudis didn't want to get audited. The Saudi government fights each other as often as they fight anyone else, but it is all obscured behind palace walls. Nominally King Salman rules, but he is ""retired."" The Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) runs things, but you'll note he's nowhere near the firstborn son, nor his father's favorite, nor are his older brothers dead. Before he became ""Crown Prince,"" there were several men that held that position with no reason given why they left it, to say nothing of offices like ""Prime Minister"" and bureaucratic offices that vary from year to year and are often created in order to be given to certain men. You get the picture: They're all competing with each other behind the scenes. This culminated with the ""Night of the Long Knives"" where soldiers and police invaded a palace and began charging many ministers with a variety of crimes. Some were arrested, others faced impromptu fines. Any pretense that they were not simply being robbed disappeared when they started guessing their net worth in order to fine them, and didn't understand that they didn't have that sort of cash in the bank. One guy even called his ""Swiss banker"" (probably Credit Suisse's wealth management division) who said there was no way to get that money over the weekend as it was tied up assets. No one is sure who is who's side, but it is believed this coup was MBS purging his rivals. This just scratches the surface. Reality involves dozens of executions being ordered due to secret evidence over breaking vague security laws. The Saudis are also big into the kefala slavery scam. They offer impoverished foreigners high wages, make them take loans to get to Saudi Arabia, seize their passports, and simply don't pay them. You can't sue the Saudi government and the oligarchs running this scam have armed retainers. The other thing the House of Saud wants to hide is they're actually really bad with money. The riches of the House of Saud started as this: Standard Oil approached King Abdulaziz of Nedj and offered him 50,000 dollars for the oil exploration rights, and the king knew so little of geology that he thought he was ripping them off. He immediately blew away the money on luxury items. And the tale goes on like that, with the king going insolvent routinely and simply making up the shortfalls with arbitrary changes to taxes, fees, and fines on western oil drillers. Things did not improve over time, as the construction magnate Mohammed bin Laden rose not by the slightest lick of competency. He was a Yemeni immigrant builder, and he was working one site where he and the German engineers the princes hired were arguing about how structurally sound the building was. Bin Laden got into the work truck and drove it up a ramp onto the roof to prove how sturdy it was. The princes found that hysterical, and fired the engineers and rewarded Bin Laden with his truck's weight in silver, and that money he used to start his own company. I'm leaving out the worst stuff, but you get the picture. There are a couple thousand of these buffoons, and none of them want to get audited. This is also why I'm suspicious of the irregular ruling favoring the shareholders over the bondholders. Riyadh is a sovereign government and there's really nothing stopping them from making legal threats to the Swiss government to cut ties, or cut trade, or seize assets. I also wish I could say UBS and/or the Swiss government are bribe proof but that simply isn't so, and there's not exactly anything people could do to stop one sovereign government from bribing another. In any case, Saudi oligarchs stand to gain or lose more than anyone else in the fall of Credit Suisse, more than even the CEO of Credit Suisse stands to lose.","The bonds are Contingent Convertible bonds and they are subordinate to equity. They are ridiculous and it is unbelievable that someone or some entity with half a brain would actually invest in them and get behind equity holders. It is proper, but just a stupid way to invest in very risky bonds.",0,0.502,1.0,NEGATIVE
