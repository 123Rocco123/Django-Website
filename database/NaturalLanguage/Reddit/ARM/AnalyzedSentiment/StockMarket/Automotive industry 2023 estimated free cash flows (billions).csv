,"A comment that’s constantly repeated in some online investing discussions is that Tesla is worth more than every other automaker, and therefore it must be overvalued. The value of a company is the present value of discounted future cash flows, and analyst consensus compiled by FactSet indicates that Tesla is expected to take the lead in cash flow in the automotive industry in 2023. Tesla has been growing their free cash flow at a rapid clip (from $1B in 2019, to $2.8B in 2020, to $5B in 2021), and is expected to continue to grow to $23.6B free cash flow by 2027 with sales of around 3.3 million automobiles (compared $10B free cash flow on 1.3 million units in 2022) as well as car software, car insurance, car service, car charging, and energy products. Meanwhile, the other automakers free cash flow is mostly stagnant, and is expected to decline as they are required to make large investments to catch up on EVs trends while selling EVs at slim and even negative profit margins. Simultaneously, rising EV adoption may cause significant declines in residual values for gasoline powered cars, and imperil the previously very profitable blue chip financing arms of major automakers. Tesla has earned its spot as the most valuable automaker. The question remains - how many times more valuable?",Is this FCFE or FCFF?Where do the Investments in Fixed Capital from?What are the individual company estimates for the Investments in Fixed Capital?,0,0.59,0.999,NEGATIVE
