,"RAADR, Inc. (OTC PINK: RDAR), a technology and software development company that provides cutting edge solutions to detect and combat cyber-bullying and cyber-harassment throughout the internet on social media platforms announced today that Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed two bills at the Capitol building in Salt Lake City on March 23, 2023. Children and teens in Utah would lose access to social media apps such as TikTok if they don’t have parental consent and face other restrictions under a first-in-the-nation law designed to shield young people from the addictive platforms, prohibit kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., and require age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state. Collectively, they seek to prevent children from being lured to apps by addictive features and from having ads promoted to them. Raadr believes this is a fantastic step to detect and combat cyber-bullying and cyber-harassment by getting parents more involved with the process. The Raadr app allows children, parents, school districts and law enforcement to monitor bullying and other threatening behavior across social media and the metaverse in real time. Brian “Baldy” Baldinger , Raadr Brand Ambassador stated, “I think this is a huge step in the right direction. I'm sure other states will be soon to follow Utah's lead. This just further proves the need of the Raadr app! ” Jacob DiMartino, Raadr CEO, stated, “This type of social media law is much needed in every state, not just Utah. The more parents are involved the more we will see a significant decrease in cyber bullying, suicide and campus violence. Parents need to be vigilant when it comes to their children's online activity and this is a great thing for Utah families.” Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior. The most common places where cyberbullying occurs are Social Media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tik Tok, Text messaging and messaging apps on mobile or tablet devices, Instant messaging, direct messaging, and online chatting over the internet, Online forums, chat rooms, and message boards,such as Reddit, Email and Online gaming communities.
