,"Market Notes: We're now only one week from the election and uncertainty is everywhere. COVID cases are on the rise, new restrictions are being put in place. This will have an impact on business and unemployment. Trump continues to claim election fraud and battleground states are warning they may not have results back on election night. At this point we aren't sure when will we have election results and if the results will be accepted. Trade tensions are on the rise with China again. The US approved a sale of arms to Taiwan. Beijing isn't happy. I've got a short list after yesterday's selloff. The trend is pointing decisively down. Watchlist: GOED is a low float, on watch ISIG is a low float, on watch CBAY has resistance at $9 AVXL has resistance at $6","Not to mention that the Republican Senate will not be sitting again until Nov. 9. There will be no new COVID relief until after the election, and possibly not until January. I don't think the stock market is going to like this.Speaking of the election, PLEASE VOTE!",0,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE
