,"Apple is reportedly gearing up to release a smart home display next year, signaling a renewed push into the smart home market. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the device will run on a new operating system called ""homeOS,"" which is based on Apple TV’s tvOS, similar to the software currently running on HomePods. The smart display is expected to support Apple apps like Calendar, Notes, and Home, and may feature magnetic mounts for wall placement. It will also incorporate Apple Intelligence, a feature missing from the current HomePod lineup.
