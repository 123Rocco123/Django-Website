Earnings: AMZN, AAPL, DKNG, COIN, INTC, MARA, SQ","TDOC will continue to be an armpit of a stock.. and hearing mental health as a pivot makes me cringe.. In mental health, pharmaceuticals generate over 90% of all revenue for services provided . As a provider, you’re incentivized to do fewer assessments, less therapy, and more prescribing. For me, I work in the healthcare billing and reimbursement field, I like the idea of TDOC as a means for expanding access to healthcare but they’re in an overly saturated market with absolutely no moat or real means of revenue generation.Change my mind.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
