,"Here are the main discussion points for Nvidia's investor day (and my expectations): New chips: Hopper (data center), Bluefield data processing (DPU) and Grace (CPU). EXPECT UPSIDE SURPRISE Data center addressable market update - previously highlighted as a $100bn opportunity. EXPECT UPSIDE SURPRISE Software/subscription opportunity across enterprise AI, metaverse, autos and gaming; POTENTIAL FOR DOWNSIDE SURPEISE AS STILL TOO EARLY FOR COMPANY TO PROVIDE DETAILS? Automotive pipeline details - previously $8bn - TOO FAR OUT TO MATTER? Buybacks following no Arm deal. MAY PROVIDE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION I think there is potential for upside from the data center side - new products and large data center opportunity. AI has really gained broad adoption beyond consumer use e.g. powering ""next gen"" cybersecurity solutions, companies are deploying AI based sales lead generation, procurement tools etc. This should be significant benefit for Nvidia and I think it is already in motion so they should be providing an update. On the flip side I think its too early to provide concrete numbers re Omniverse, Nvidia's version of industrial metaverse, which may be a downside surprise for some investors. Some more details on both: https://spear-invest.com/nvidia-the-one-stop-ai-shop/ I think on balance ok but don't expect huge upside surprise. Would love to hear what people think ahead of the investor day","It's a buy, just need patient for the hold.",0,0.552,0.94,POSITIVE

That's been my life this past 2 months,1,0.522,0.999,POSITIVE
