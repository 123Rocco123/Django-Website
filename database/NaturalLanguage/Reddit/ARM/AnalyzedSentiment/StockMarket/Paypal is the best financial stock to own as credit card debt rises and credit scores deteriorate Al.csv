,"As someone with a bad credit score, so bad I can’t even get a credit card, I am left with few options to pay for stuff online. I don’t think I’m the only person in this mess and even with a “good economy” moving forward more and more people will get squeezed out of credit cards and have few choices of which PayPal is the best. Millennials also are the first generation to accept PayPal with open arms but despise larger financial companies like Visa and MasterCard. After a lot of reading PayPal has positioned themselves perfectly to take advantage well into the future. Online sales are only going to grow and PayPal will definitely always get a piece of that and as sales grow that piece will grow. The subset of people that can’t get a credit card will only grow and continue to be ignored by most all economic metrics that are released. Similar to how unemployment has nothing really to do with how many people are not working. That disconnect will be good for PayPal.","V, MA, and PYPL are all good to own.",0,0.519,1.0,POSITIVE

MA is no different but over the years I’ve used both and always thought Visa was easier to deal with and did less stuff associated with “nickel and diming” customers and while that’s good for the bottom line in the short term. Long term they will loose market share.If I had to pick though I’d choose PayPal to outperform V and MA considerably well into the future.,1,0.535,0.991,NEGATIVE

I said they love PayPal and despise(maybe that’s strong) larger companies.It is not news that the younger generation doesn’t exactly love capitalism and the giant companies it has created. Most polls show about 50% of that generation support socialism.What’s pointless about predicting behavior?Using anecdotal evidence has worked for some companies. Tesla,1,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

Read the earnings reports don’t just pull things randomly from your life. It will get you burned eventually.

Chase Safire card targets those types of users and do take bad credit.Square owns cash app which is also popular with that age demographic and that can be used on e-commerce and has a stock / trading platform attached to it if you want Robinhood like company since Robinhood is not public.PayPal owning Venmo is the biggest reason I would look at PayPal. PayPal name only carries weight with the older side of the demographic you would want to target. But Venmo name hits all of the demographic.Apple and Goldman Sachs with the Apple Card is also the big player. When I see a young person with a credit card it is usually Apple or Chase Saphire. They will lower standards in Down economy to keep getting the holy grail of consumers (18-25).,0,0.533,0.991,NEGATIVE

I would think that would cause a dip and then the company would change behavior and it would bounce back. If you look at the chart you will notice a pattern like that back in 2015-16 but how is that relevant to any intellectual discussion about the future of the stock.Even if it’s true shorting a stock like that is riskay.I’d suggest don’t buy it.I’d suggest you shouldn’t invest at all if your basing your decisions on 5 year old news.It’s like buying Apple bc you just realized they sell a watch too,1,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE

PayPal is the easiest way around that. Visa has there hand in the market too with there visa gift cards you load cash on.It doesn’t have so much to do with people being broke as much as it has to do with those that have little to no credit but still buy online.Out of touch.
