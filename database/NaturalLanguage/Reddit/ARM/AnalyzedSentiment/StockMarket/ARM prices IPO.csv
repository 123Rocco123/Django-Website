,Think this valuation is too high?,"Well based on my researchâ€¦Revenue 23 Revenue 22 Revenue 21$2.66 B $2.71 B. $2.00 BProfit 23 Profit 22 Profit 21$0.448 B $0.654 B $0.22 BIf you are okay buying a company x25 times revenue and x100 times profit then it is a good price, but I believe this is a premium price to pay for a company that hasnâ€™t exponentially grown their revenue in the past 3 years.If the growth was higher than 10% yoy then I would see maybe a possibility to justify that value.However, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has decided to invest up to NT$100 million in their pre-IPO, thatâ€™s good news for the company as bigger companies believe in the future of ARM",0,0.582,0.93,NEGATIVE
,Think this valuation is too high?,Itâ€™s a P/E of 104 on a slight revenue decline. Fuck that noise,1,0.515,0.998,NEGATIVE

,Think this valuation is too high?,SoftBank paid 32B in 2016. Sold 25% to their clients for 8B. Bought that back for 16B to value the company at 64B. A month later they price the IPO at 54B.So they already lost 10B on valuation in a month.SoftBank is in this for 40B which is incidentally the amount nvidia was going to pay - 3 years ago.Yeah itâ€™s going to tank as SoftBank tries to exit this boat anchor.Seriously 3% annualized return? Theyâ€™re IPOing it at an inflation adjusted loss.,1,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

,Think this valuation is too high?,SoftBank needs a massive overhaul.Masayoshi Son needs to retire at this point. He has lost his touch (if he ever had one?). Canâ€™t believe he still has oil-rich countries in the Middle East giving him money.,2,0.516,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Think this valuation is too high?,If softbank is the backer then stay away from it,2,0.501,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Think this valuation is too high?,Not just backer - current 100% owner. Theyâ€™re only IPOing 10% so theyâ€™ll still be the majority owner.I would expect them to try to sell off another 30% on the open market over the next year.,3,0.568,0.93,POSITIVE

,Think this valuation is too high?,Yes it is. If you look at the recent IPOs theyâ€™ve all gone down like 50% since IPO. I think I saw 1 that was green. Honestly unless youâ€™re planning to go all in on ARM thereâ€™s no reason not to wait for it to either drop in price or shoot up then stabilize farther down at a lower price.,0,0.505,0.6,POSITIVE

,Think this valuation is too high?,"Because I donâ€™t care? Iâ€™m sure I will look at it in the future but itâ€™s not my priority right now. Also Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d you understand how shorting works. There need to be loanable shares in order to short a stock.You realize the stock will be available in the future right? If itâ€™s worth $200 and valued at $150 sure Iâ€™ll hop in. I donâ€™t have enough information on it right now and like I said previously, just based on this years IPOs that Iâ€™ve seen itâ€™s more than likely going to dip after awhile.

It's baffling how scared everybody is, given the competition, this is a very low valuation. They have extreme dominance in a niche area by itself, design patents. I am sure as hell vast majority of people have literally never heard of this company before, including me. However they are apparently responsible for god damn everything.
