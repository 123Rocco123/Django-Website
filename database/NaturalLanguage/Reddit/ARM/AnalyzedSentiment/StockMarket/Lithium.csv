,"Hello everyone, me again. I am looking into the vehicle market. With everyone talking about Elon musk currently it got me thinking. He’s known for his vast company known as Tesla. He’s really put the “EV” sector into light so to speak. Some might say put the sector into “solar”. Just a R.E. Joke. Don’t ban me. 😂 But, through this process it’s really pushed a lot of automakers into the “arms race” so to speak. Whether it’s VW, Ford, or GM, to name a few. Current administration has been harping heavily on forms of renewable energy. I think everyone can recall the North American pipeline being shut down. With tensions still with Russia probably going to see a bit of growth in the sector, no? But what does a EV car need most? A battery. Anyone here heavy into a specific lithium ETF? I haven’t found many, most have high expense ratios too. The ones I have found thus far is; LIT, BATT, CHRG, ARKQ, QCLN. Anyone else see this as potentially undervalued sector?","Most of these companies are located in China with a smattering of Australia + Emerging Markets. The problem is these ETFs have high expense ratios since many of these companies are foreign listed.Also, a lot of the ETFs mentioned aren’t commodities plays. Even LIT isn’t a pure play. The others less so.Personally, I’d go for an Industrial Metal ETF. But frankly, those are going to have piss poor returns compared to other options, IMHO. There’s not a lot of profit in mining metals, just increased production.",0,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE

Anyone else see this as potentially undervalued sector?","I am very interested in this sector. Lithium and lithium refining will be extremely profitable as the EV industry takes off. Most people still do not understand, and most people are still buying ICE vehicles. In the coming decades, EVs will take over the market share, and buying an ICE vehicle will just be for hobbyists. So the opportunity will is still very valued. With that said, even finding a good industry does not necessarily mean that a given stock in that industry will do well. The company may have huge debt, huge unnecessary business expenses, be poorly managed, or have owners that completely dilute the market share and sell out. A good stock is a good company that rewards shareholders. Lithium companies have several unknown risks, so don’t just think it is easy money.Investing in the mineral itself seems like a good idea, similar to how people buy gold. Although, it is possible that supply grows with demand, and the return on investment will not be as much as you had hoped. With that said, if I were going to buy some metal to put in my vault, I would probably consider lithium.",0,0.57,0.996,POSITIVE
