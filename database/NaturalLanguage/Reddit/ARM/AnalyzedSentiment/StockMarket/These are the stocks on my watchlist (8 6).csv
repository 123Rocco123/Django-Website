,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: $6.4 Trillion Stock Wipeout Has Traders Fearing ‘Great Unwind’ Is Just Starting NVDA - Lot of excellent movers, my favorite one yesterday was NVDA. Long from $96 cost basis (original was 93). Was very confident in a bounce yesterday, but not sure if I’m confident that we’ll surge off the option like yesterday. Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: AMD, ARM, MU, SOXL, NVDL UBER - Reports 0.47 vs 0.31 expected EPS, revenue of 10.7B vs 10.6B expected. Guidance is fairly in line with future expectations, and cited strong demand for services. INTC - We saw a move in this at the open yesterday that had a pretty huge selloff (close to 5%) when the other semi-stocks were pretty resilient and recovered some of their move, will likely be looking at this off the open to see if this sells off again. Note this one did NOT recover, mainly due to the poor earnings last week. PLTR - Revenue guidance raised to $2.74B and adjusted operating income raised by $80M more than expected. This earnings was significant due to CFO alluding to possible inclusion in SP500. EPS of 0.06. EWJ - Japan ETF. Solely worth watching because so much of the current move is happening overnight in Asian markets. Earnings I’m watching: ABNB, RIVN, RDDT","Intel looks promising. In one month nearly went down 50%, think is going to keep going down or it will come back up in the 6months- 1 year?",0,0.567,NEGATIVE,1.0
