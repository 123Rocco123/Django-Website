,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: Fed Seen Rejecting Calls for Jumbo Rate Cut in Economist Survey There will be no post Monday/Tuesday. SG - Reports -.13 EPS vs -.11 expected. Raised full year outlook, causing surge in stock prices. TTWO - Beats on latest earnings, EPS of 0.05 vs .01 exp. This was a huge earnings beat, but adjusted sales were lighter than expected. In other news, the Borderlands movie gets a 7% on Rotten Tomatoes lol. TSM - Reported earnings (in Taiwan) overnight. Reported 45% increase in revenue, and good guidance, sales for the month. Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: AMD/ARM/MU/SOXL/NVDA/NVDL. Still long NVDA. ASTS - Saw a continued up move from yesterday, watching $25 level. RKLB - Met revenue expectations of $106M vs $105-110M expected.

Long term hold strategy. However, when we saw ""day traders"" getting into one of our stocks, we'd work them a bit. Our traders knew who held the large positions in our stocks so we could go direct if we saw someone unloading or loading up, hence cutting costs.In my opinion, day traders typically lose over the long haul. Oh, and I missed on Nvidia, it was on my buy list 4 years ago, I just didn't have anything I wanted to exit at that time to free up cash. I trimmed my APPL holdings by 50% in June to add TSM. I want to be on the supplier side of AI rather than the developer side. Plus my APPL holding weighting was getting out of range on a risk management basis.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.997
