Typically with acquisitions once you have the purchase price it is directly priced or reflected in the stock. Thats why when GILD paid a 100% premium you saw the stock jump 100% and then stay relatively flat. In other words, the stock will stay at the price of the acquisition. So really only way to play these pumps is to own before hand, and the timing the move is near impossible. You have to be really familiar with the companies and comfortable with the idea of holding indefinitely until a catalyst takes place... imo",1,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
