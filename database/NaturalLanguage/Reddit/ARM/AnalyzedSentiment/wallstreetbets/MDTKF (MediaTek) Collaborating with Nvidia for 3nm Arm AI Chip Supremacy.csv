,"There have been rumors about MediaTek and Nvidia joining forces to develop a 3nm Arm “AI” PC chip based on Arm technology (Dan Nystedt on Twitter). MediaTek will likely provide the system-on-chip (combining all the components into one chip). It seems that their share on this will be significant and can be a seriously huge income for MediaTek. The interesting thing is.. Yesterday, Dell (one of the OEM’s) was literally teasing next to Jensen (ceo of Nvidia) that they are coming with an AI cpu next year.. (confirming the rumors essentially) Fuck the AI snakeoil buzzwords, but essentially we know already that the arm architecture has proven superior in battery life and performance, as seen in the MacBook Pro M chips compared to older Intel models. Windows is being redesigned for ARM and this is a huge market in the following years. Leakers speculate at a reveal at Computex Taipei 2024 which starts the 4th of June, but Nvidia will already do a keynote the 2nd of June. Let’s talk numbers. MediaTek currently has a market cap of $59.55 billion and a P/E ratio of just 22.3. It’s cheapo compared to novideo, ayymd and incel. Price is up (although not as much as competitors) last 6 months but I think this is not fully priced in. Also, free AI hype bonus: Everyone is going to go crazy if the company manages to ride the AI wave, considering Nvidia's tendency to generate massive hype. Beginning of june (2nd - 7th) is going to be wild. Keep an eye on this one.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
