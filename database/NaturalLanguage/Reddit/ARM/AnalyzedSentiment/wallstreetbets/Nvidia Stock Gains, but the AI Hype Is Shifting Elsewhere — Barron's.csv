,"Nvidia was edging up Friday but the chip maker's rally has been leveling out slightly as other stocks related to artificial intelligence take the spotlight. Nvidia shares were rising 0.4% to $699.45 in premarket trading. Nvidia stock closed down 0.7% at $696.41 on Thursday, after breaking through the $700 barrier and setting a new record high the previous day. Nvidia's rally has left it outpacing Wall Street targets, with analysts having an average target price on the stock of $687.70, according to FactSet. That appears to have prompted investors to focus on other stocks poised to benefit from investment in AI. Chip designer Arm Holdings and power-management device maker Monolithic Power Systems both surged on Thursday after their respective earnings, which were boosted by spending on AI. Both are now notably more expensive than Nvidia on a forward price-to-earnings basis but investors looked eager to spread their AI bets across the market. Among other chip makers on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices was down 0.1% and Intel was up 0.4%. Nvidia shares have risen 27% over the last month. The S&P 500 has risen 4.5% over the same period and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 5.5%. Nvidia's trading volume of 41.4 million on Thursday was slightly below its 65-day average of 43.3 million.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
