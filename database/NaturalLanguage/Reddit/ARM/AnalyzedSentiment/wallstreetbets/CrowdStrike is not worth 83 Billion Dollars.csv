,"Thesis: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing). Fear: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard. OBSERVATIONS The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “Cloud”, “Software Engineering”, and “Cyber Security”. The median “Cyber Security Analyst” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security” The median “Software Engineer” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security” and “Cloud” The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “markets” and “liquidity pools” CRITIQUES Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees. CrowdStrike’s utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer’s data and display it on a dashboard. CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms. CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm’s data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for “correlation” CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena. CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating “fake hacking stories” which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society. Properly built “cloud applications” have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the ""software supply chain"". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). CrowdStrike’s Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of “Zero-Trust Security”. COMMENTARY CrowdStrike’s product includes a “client” which runs on every ""customer endpoint” (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business’s own “cloud application”. These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated. CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business’ “endpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to ""draw insights""; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE. It’s prohibitively hard to hack into a “cloud system” due to few possible entry points Exfiltrating data at scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than ""threat-actors"". Containerize Everything + Microservices Architecture hampers ""lateral movement"". Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises? The CrowdStrike Story So Far… 2020 “Uses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches” “Runs on your endpoint or server or workload” “Signature based technologies don’t go far enough” “We collect trillions of events” “There hasn’t been a salesforce of security” — FAST FORWARD — 2024 Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media.

,"Thesis: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing). Fear: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard. OBSERVATIONS The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “Cloud”, “Software Engineering”, and “Cyber Security”. The median “Cyber Security Analyst” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security” The median “Software Engineer” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security” and “Cloud” The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “markets” and “liquidity pools” CRITIQUES Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees. CrowdStrike’s utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer’s data and display it on a dashboard. CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms. CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm’s data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for “correlation” CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena. CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating “fake hacking stories” which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society. Properly built “cloud applications” have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the ""software supply chain"". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). CrowdStrike’s Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of “Zero-Trust Security”. COMMENTARY CrowdStrike’s product includes a “client” which runs on every ""customer endpoint” (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business’s own “cloud application”. These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated. CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business’ “endpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to ""draw insights""; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE. It’s prohibitively hard to hack into a “cloud system” due to few possible entry points Exfiltrating data at scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than ""threat-actors"". Containerize Everything + Microservices Architecture hampers ""lateral movement"". Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises? The CrowdStrike Story So Far… 2020 “Uses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches” “Runs on your endpoint or server or workload” “Signature based technologies don’t go far enough” “We collect trillions of events” “There hasn’t been a salesforce of security” — FAST FORWARD — 2024 Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media.
