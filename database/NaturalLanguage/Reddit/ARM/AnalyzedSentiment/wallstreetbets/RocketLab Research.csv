,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.  Injector testing underway.  Pre-burner tests underway. 2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner. 2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production. My Prediction: • First Neutron flight: 2025.  • First successful Neutron flight: 2025/2026.  • First successful Neutron landing: 2026/2027.  • First Neutron reuse: 1 year after the first Neutron landing.

RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production.

Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.  Injector testing underway.  Pre-burner tests underway. 2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner. 2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production. My Prediction: • First Neutron flight: 2025.  • First successful Neutron flight: 2025/2026.  • First successful Neutron landing: 2026/2027.  • First Neutron reuse: 1 year after the first Neutron landing.

Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies.

Position: 7000 shares 1st purchase in June 2021","That will be an interesting time.Current Starship estimates are 100 to 150 tons to LEO. So 6.6 to 10 times more than Neutrons barge landing LEO capacity. I am not sure about the price though. SpaceX already spend > $5 billion dollars on the starship development. And the first few years the starships are already sold (Artemis mission, Musks Mars mission etc.)Another important aspect: if you deploy a constellation like Starlink you do not put every satellite into the same orbital plane. You need to insert the satellites into different orbital planes- so launching 100 or even 150 tons of satellites into a single orbital plane does not make sense. You could of course solve that with orbital transfer vehicles, but that adds weight and cost. So let's see how that plays out long term.If Starships becomes dominating RocketLab positioned Neutron well to scale it up. Instead of Merlins gas generator engine they went with a ox rich staged combustion engine. One can expect performance gains over time (look at how much Blue Origin gets out of a ox rich staged combustion engine of similar size.If satellites and payloads in general become significantly larger and heavier due to Starship RocketLab could use the same engines for the heavy lift rocket and maybe even use the Neutron 1st stage as a 2nd stage of the heavy lift rocket. Starship is 50 meters high and 9 meter wide. Neutron is 42 meters high and 7 meters wide. Plus the tank parts are potentially stretchable.",1,0.514,0.871,POSITIVE
,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk.

Position: 7000 shares 1st purchase in June 2021","Keep in mind Starship already has commercial contracts, too. Tough to argue it’s not already dominating. Neutron will be essentially a Falcon 9 competitor in terms of price, capacity, and accuracy, but likely never in reliability. I don’t think “just scale it up” works for 10x. Unless you’re paying for it. My concern with RKLB is they’re fighting the last war, so to speak, and at best will be competing for third place in the launch market. We can debate the size of that market and how valuable third place is, but there’s a ceiling.",2,0.521,0.998,NEGATIVE

Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.

This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.  Injector testing underway.  Pre-burner tests underway. 2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner. 2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production. My Prediction: • First Neutron flight: 2025.  • First successful Neutron flight: 2025/2026.  • First successful Neutron landing: 2026/2027.  • First Neutron reuse: 1 year after the first Neutron landing. Position: 7000 shares 1st purchase in June 2021",Fair points. Especially that Starlink is an amazing cashcow. And RocketLab does not have the funds (yet?) to replicate that.SpaceX launch frequency is impressive. But: RocketLab scaled Electron faster to 50 launches that SpaceX scaled F9 to 50 launches- even with reuse.If they can replicate that and also scale Neutron faster than SpaceX scaled F9 it could get even in that regard interesting.Not handing your competitor cash (Amazon Kuiper vs. Starlink) is a big incentive to go with the maybe slightly more expensive option.SpaceX is still clearly ahead. And by a margin. But that competition gets more interesting by the day. And the valuation difference is too high. SpaceX is valued at $200 billion in private. In public it would probably be >$500 b.It doesn't make sense that RocketLab is only valued at $5 b. So far they are 2nd behind SpaceX. They are scaling their revenue impressively. From $60 m to $400m in like 4 years. With positive gross margins. They should be valued higher already in my opinion -> reason for me to buy in.,1,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner?

Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week.

Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight.

Plus, Musk isnt intending to use Starship for commercial constellation goals, its a heavy lift intended for human and interplanetary travel. There is plenty of demand for Neutron to capture commercial and gov't contracts; for people who are direct competitors to SpaceX and cant get the orbit they want through them.Neutron will have a faster turnaround time than F9. It's been designed to be the most cost efficient commercial rocket in history from the get-go; every single detail.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge.

Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.  Injector testing underway.  Pre-burner tests underway. 2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner. 2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation.

My Prediction: • First Neutron flight: 2025.  • First successful Neutron flight: 2025/2026.  • First successful Neutron landing: 2026/2027.  • First Neutron reuse: 1 year after the first Neutron landing.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production.

The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.  Injector testing underway.  Pre-burner tests underway. 2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner. 2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production.

Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.

,"Valuation Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential. For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation. The important question is: How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner? Probability of Neutron Success To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services. Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles Electron Timeline 2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year. 2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced. 2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification. 2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: When the Heavens Went on Sale - Ashlee Vance). 2018 January: First successful Electron launch. 2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week. Falcon 1 Timeline 2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave). 2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas). 2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave). 2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor). 2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing. 2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure). 2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight. Summary It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight. Additional Points: SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).  RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.  SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.  RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies. Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight. Bonus: Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites. What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron? In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process. The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk. Neutron Timeline 2021 March: Neutron introduced. 2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced. Q2 2023 First full-scale thrust chamber completed.  Injector testing underway.  Pre-burner tests underway. 2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner. 2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production.
