Think of all the people who use macs - they don’t care about gaming, and are willing to spend 1000$s on their devices. Of course you should expect a completely hassle free experience if you are trying to run games through some Rosetta equivalent. Ultimately as this tech gets adopted, and more people use it, developers will release compatible builds of their games with native performance. That’s not a hardware/tech issue.I hardly think that means that windows on arm will never be used, as there are clear advantages in the laptop space.

My point was who the hell is trying to run elden ring on these systems? If you want a gaming rig, buy a gaming rig. They are not competing there because it would decimate their primary selling point which is battery life. As for native software, my point stands. Software companies aren’t in the habit of releasing software for platforms that no one is interested in. People are interested in windows on arm due to them having much better compute power per watt, as evidenced by the Mac M series success reviving apples laptop brand, which was dead under intel.

THAT'S THE POINT.they only have low-mid perf at low watt. their performance is unacceptable at gaming, and like i said (twice) already - when they need to emulate (which is like, all the time), they lose efficiency... when it even works. which it often doesn't. their curve is lower than amd's last gen. and that's when shit actually works.you CLEARLY don't know what you're talking about. stop pretending/claiming otherwise, it's not working.Therefore, as the tech becomes increasingly available in hardware and supported in software, arm will see growth in this sector.you still spout this drivel, apparently not understanding what windows is. ffs, (again) this is the 3rd attempt at windows on arm.",6,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE

INTC too IIRC gets a quarter of its revenue from China. I forget which off hand but I think it was ARM, and it got 40-41% of its revenue from China in Q3.should any chip related firm no longer able to import materials or components from China, and more significantly, no longer export their products to sell in China, they will have a significant material impact on revenue that could vary wildly from 20-30% to even 49-50% varying on the supply chain impact.personally I think Taiwan Strait war is MAD but it may not necessarily take the form of full-on invasion. minor attacks on infrastructure and no loss of life could take place which still result trade sanctions that are to the material detriment of many chip firms but including ARM.that said, there’s likely no long equity hedge against it as likely everything would sell off.the hedge would be cash or near-cash kept safe and liquid to buy ARM, INTC, etc cheaply in the aftermath as in the long term they would stand to benefit from any decline in TSMC.",0,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
