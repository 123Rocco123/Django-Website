,"I have been watching the AI hardware game play out, and I my theory is that Qualcomm is ridiculously under valued vs other AI hardware providers. Qualcomm's latest offerings on device are powerful enough to do some really interesting things on device as we can see with the S24 ultra. All of a sudden phones can begin to do more locally vs just being a portal into the internet. I think more interestingly, Qualcomm is in theory about to come into desktop computing in a big way with the x elite desktop chip. I get it if people think Qualcomm has no room for growth on phones because they are already top dog, but they could potentially completely destroy intel and amd in the laptop and potentially desktop market. Apples m chips are ridiculously better then anything intel or apple can throw at laptops without paying insane gamer money, and the x elite will prolly be the same, which btw Microsoft is betting on with windows 12. Imagine if Microsoft starts to depend on x elite for copilot??? Next up you have their ai 100 inference cards, which seem to be ridiculously good at doing cost effective inference. From what I can tell, they have all been snapped up by large cloud providers and they most likely didn't produce enough, and hopefully they are ramping up production. So, these guys dominate phones with the best stuff, Microsoft is making windows 12 compatible with arm architecture for the first time ever and they have the first and only option (and it looks like it will be hands down better in both general computing and ai workloads then what's on the market). And to top it off they have a credible line of ai inference server cards that are selling like hotcakes. What on earth is going on with their stock price? You have to really think people think xelite and server inference hardware will be literally worthless to have the current valuation. These guys are coming for nvidia, intel, and amds pie and they have a really credible shot at taking a huge slice of their traditional market and the new ai stuff.

,"I have been watching the AI hardware game play out, and I my theory is that Qualcomm is ridiculously under valued vs other AI hardware providers. Qualcomm's latest offerings on device are powerful enough to do some really interesting things on device as we can see with the S24 ultra.

I think more interestingly, Qualcomm is in theory about to come into desktop computing in a big way with the x elite desktop chip.

Apples m chips are ridiculously better then anything intel or apple can throw at laptops without paying insane gamer money, and the x elite will prolly be the same, which btw Microsoft is betting on with windows 12.

I even mentioned it in my bachelor's thesis a few years ago. The correction made QC dip nicely in 2023. It's still undervalued imo.Microsoft and QC are aiming to become the counterbalance to Apple and Apple Silicon. Which will allow QC to remain the top dog in AR and VR too. Which will allow them to stay relevant in the smartphone industry. All of which is good news if youre planning on holding for longer than 2 quarters.I knew from an insider that QC was having lots of trouble trying to beat Apple Silicon. They poached the Apple Silicon arhitects to save the project. And that's when this sub found out.,2,0.524,0.988,NEGATIVE
