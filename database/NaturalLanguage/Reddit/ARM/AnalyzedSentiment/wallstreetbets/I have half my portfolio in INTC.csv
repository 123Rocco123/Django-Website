,"Tell me why I'm wrong 😆 Their 18A process is best in class Their x86 chips will be way more efficient on 18A The ARM chips on 18A will be more efficient than competitors Their GPUs are only a generation or two behind Nvidia. Their AI platform (gaudi) is already more efficient that Nvidia and is only a generation or two behind in terms of raw horsepower. If we think about compute in general let's say 33% cloud, 33% HPC/AI, 33% edge. Right now Intel is a major player in all 3 markets. Xeon isn't going anywhere and once 18A process starts moving volumes it will be such a huge jump in performance that all these cloud vendors that have been extending lifecycles will finally have a reason to upgrade. Gaudi will become more competitive over time as companies start to realize that nuclear power stations for data centers are not really a good idea. The power density required for nvidias chips just isn't sustainable. ARM is a big threat to Intels x86 market but it's also a big opportunity for Intel foundry. The efficiency of ARM chip design is largely the same given they're using the same core architectures. Where Apple really has been excelling is using the latest process technologies to build more efficient edge compute. Intel with their state of the art 18A coming online around the world will soon having companies lined up for ARM production that will handily outperform TSMCs latest offering. Intel GPUs are getting more and more competitive with Nvidia every generation. In terms of gaming I see them becoming a more and more of a thorn in nvidias side, but that's just GPUs... I just don't see why nvda can be possibly worth 20x Intel when Intel has so many more growth opportunities. If all goes well in the world then Intel will continue to play a major role in the global compute market. If all goes to hell in the world then Intel will be the single most critical company in the world as global chip supply becomes completely disrupted in Taiwan and Intel's new factories become the only way to keep our world moving forward. Already Biden is escalating the trade war with China. Imagine if it gets to the point where the US decides to permanently dismantle TSMC's entire manufacturing capacity then imagine what that will do to global chip supply. All it would take is one wrong move by China to seize control over the strait and USA will undoubtedly destroy the manufacturing before letting it fall under Chinese control.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

Even AMD with some pretty good GPUs in recent generations has struggled to make much of a dent against NVDA. Intel won't be the performance leader in that segment anytime soon.
