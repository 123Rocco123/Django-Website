He mic-checked the hell out of anyone who was thinking stupidly about this with a purple eggplant swing - Check out my 5000 patents. And that's the game folks. You can't just come out and say you're making something and NOT worry about those patents. Nevertheless, people keep mentioning Risc-V and open source. Ok. Welcome. I don't think there is anything wrong with competition. In fact, I think competition is very good for this space. AMD is Nvidia's competition and innovation and progress drives from this and it is good. It's the way it should be. Moreso, the revenues can actually help each other out because that would mean people are coming into the space that need paid for their innovation. Arm can raise prices and so can Risc-V. Open Source Software does NOT mean FREE. Open Source Software simply means that this PART is free but everything else like install, consultation, support, expertise, referrals, compute, cloud, data centers will ALL cost you. It's how open source makes money. Thankfully the foundations of some Open Source Software technology is well founded for the purpose of making core and important technologies available in a pure Open Source Software way. The Linux Foundation Linux Kernel Development Apache Software Foundation Mozilla Foundation Free Software Foundation OSI Google Summer of Code GSoC Chrome Just to name a few. These foundations are powered by money from the biggest names in tech and that often are never realized by regular non-tech industry people and more so they sure the hell aren't even thanked by anyone really for doing it. From individual contributors to IBM Microsoft Google ARM Apple Oracle Many Others All give real dollars to these projects to stay alive and afloat. However, other Open Source Software goes into the business without great institutional support. Examples of this are even publicly traded companies such as MongoDB. They give you Open Source Software but they also provide a hand holding version via their cloud business. Redis is another great example of this but they are not publicly traded. Other Open Source Software such as Risc-V has other plans of profiting and that is completely OK. I just think the mistake is thinking someone is going to jump in with free software and that is going to kill someone else business. Remember when Microsoft damn near cried (joking) when Linux arrived? What happened? Well, now Ubuntu is probably the most dominant OS on the planet BECAUSE of all the cloud vendors providing it for cloud compute. You wouldn't realize Linux is the most dominant OS but it is. With data centers, Android, and you could argue Unix(Apple) is all Linux kernel based. For this reason Open Source Software is the dominant OS on the planet developed by 1 man. Crazy. As you see Microsoft sure does well even though the other reality people may not realize is something different. With all of that there is nothing that prevents ARM using Risc-V as their own architecture IF they actually wanted to. The same as there was nothing stopping Microsoft from using Chrome in their Edge browser. If it makes financial sense they'll do it. Hardware is HARD. The upward hill climb for Open Source Software to be the exact thing your billion dollar business needs without ANY help/consulting or tooling is NET ZERO. Somewhere in that cycle there is going to be something you pay for. Again, Open Source Software does NOT MEAN FREE. ARM has a ridiculously LOW royalty rate to boot. It's not like their getting a dollar a phone they're getting PENNIES for all that goodness. Still there is room for others such as Risc-V. Lastly, ARMS army of patents is nothing to sleep on and at ~7000 patents is the definition of a MOAT if you ask me and an R&D in the 100's of millions I don't think you're going to get Open Source Software penetrating that for years to come.

The best analyst question and right to the heart of the dagger here was from Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. This could be a post but I already did this one for today.The earnings surprise came from the V9/Neoverse and the associated double royalty rates. This is the premium Neoverse chip in all of the high-end compute architectures. Rene said yes, this was the first time they put it in writing because people were asking questions about it.He also explained in many cases it's even more. That coupled with more installations of those chips provided the gas for the earnings drive. Double is a good rule of thumb for like-for-like of the lower end V8 / V9 but the really really good ones doing the AI are even more than double.",0,0.542,0.999,POSITIVE

However, other Open Source Software goes into the business without great institutional support. Examples of this are even publicly traded companies such as MongoDB.

Other Open Source Software such as Risc-V has other plans of profiting and that is completely OK.

Remember when Microsoft damn near cried (joking) when Linux arrived? What happened? Well, now Ubuntu is probably the most dominant OS on the planet BECAUSE of all the cloud vendors providing it for cloud compute. You wouldn't realize Linux is the most dominant OS but it is.

As you see Microsoft sure does well even though the other reality people may not realize is something different. With all of that there is nothing that prevents ARM using Risc-V as their own architecture IF they actually wanted to. The same as there was nothing stopping Microsoft from using Chrome in their Edge browser. If it makes financial sense they'll do it. Hardware is HARD. The upward hill climb for Open Source Software to be the exact thing your billion dollar business needs without ANY help/consulting or tooling is NET ZERO. Somewhere in that cycle there is going to be something you pay for. Again, Open Source Software does NOT MEAN FREE. ARM has a ridiculously LOW royalty rate to boot. It's not like their getting a dollar a phone they're getting PENNIES for all that goodness. Still there is room for others such as Risc-V. Lastly, ARMS army of patents is nothing to sleep on and at ~7000 patents is the definition of a MOAT if you ask me and an R&D in the 100's of millions I don't think you're going to get Open Source Software penetrating that for years to come.
