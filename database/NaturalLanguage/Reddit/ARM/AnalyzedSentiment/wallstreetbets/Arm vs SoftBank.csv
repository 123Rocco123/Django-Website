If Softbank went to dump all of their holdings in an afternoon they'd bring that valuation down to a few billion. As others have said market cap is super fluffy and could just fall on its own by 50% for whatever geopolitical/financial crisis of the moment pops up.When you're valuing a bank it's worth digging into their portfolio and the loans they hold. I dont think Softbank is reckless despite WeWork. When you have all the money in the world and own everything, you're sure to make some big mess ups. They owned Ali Baba from IPO and exited for some great profit as a counter to that.Banks are also HEAVILY influenced by forex, exchange rates, etc. Venture capital is ""perfectly-competitive"". Every country around the world has hundreds of banks that do venture capital. ARM has hard to develop hardware architecture.I think you'll be fine if you bought SoftBank today anyways and held for 5 years.

I would invest into a company that makes d*ldoes if it returns over 100% per year.The reason ARM is going up so much is because they will replace majority of AMD and Intel PC chips, as ARM chips are more power consumption friendly.Edit: ""not necessarily replace, but take some of the market share""I had 4 posts shut down on RDDT this year because I was trying to tell reg*rds that ARM and SFTBY are solid investments.
