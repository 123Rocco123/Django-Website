,,"It’s all volume and volatility. While I was more careful up to my road to 25k, now at this point it’s buying 10s of thousands of dollars worth of out of the money calls a new strikes out waiting for a small movement and day trading. ARM has a 30% movement today so one of my small trades went huge and ended up returning almost 14k. I just post gains to shit post but honestly there is no real strategy behind it. I try and chart and be as due diligent as possible but with this level of IV on options it’s any man’s game.",1,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Still the same industry of stocks that being semiconductors such as NVDA, ARM, SMCI, AMD and some COIN because bitcoin is going up due to china losing trillions of dollars and their people switching back to digital currency. The premiums for the options are honestly getting out of control and almost too much. ARM out of the money strikes of 185 used to be like .5 a day ago now it’s all in the hundreds of dollars. It’s fine for day trading but SUPER risky because of IV crush and with it being so far away out of the money a small 1-2 dollar movement down can cost you all you me money especially buying 20k worth of 2.00 calls.",3,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,Yeah semiconductors are way over valued currently but it’s the value that people see in these 10 years from now is why they’re exploding as well as small market caps compared to NVDA. SMCI and ARM are babies compared to NVDAs 1.7 trillion cap so 20-50 billion dollars drives their price in any direction at any moment,5,0.525,0.98,NEGATIVE
,,How out of the money are we talking. My big fear would be not having the volume to find a buyer or seller. Nothing worse thst sitting on a nice profit but not a single mothefucker out there willing to be on the other side for you to realize that profit,2,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
