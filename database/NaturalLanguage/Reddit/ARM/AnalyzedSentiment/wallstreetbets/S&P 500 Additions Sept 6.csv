,"The S&P is rebalanced four times a year. Two weeks before the rebalancing, they announce which companies will be added and removed from the index. The next rebalancing occurs on Sept. 20, which means they will announce the additions and deletions to the index on Sept. 6 after the market close. S&P rebalancing is one of my favorite trades because it has asymmetric risk-reward. If the stock is added to the index, it usually goes up 5-10%. If it isn't added, it usually only goes down 1-3%. I've made a small fortune in the past with this technique by successfully predicting the additions of Palo Alto, Blackstone, and Crowdstrike. The S&P 500 selection committee does have some requirements for a stock to join the index. Generally speaking, the company needs to be profitable for four quarters and have a minimum market cap of 18 billion. The full list of requirements is here on pages 7-12 of the PDF file. https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf Here is list of potential candidates based on market cap: NOTE: Some of these are not profitable and therefore ineligible for S&P500 inclusion.
