,"In 1906, what began as a modest correction from all-time highs in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, led to liquidity drying up, straining financial systems and causing a huge sell-off and liquidity crunch. The Dow Jones plummeted as much as 50% in the following year! (granted, markets were less liquid as they are today). The DowJones was the key index back in the industrial era, which has been replaced by the NASDAQ 100. Currently, we have been at ATHs in the S&P500 and the NASDAQ, with big tech leading the charge. This has led to very high, expensive (PE ratio) valuations. The Republicans have begun the shakiness, leading hedge funds and institutions to re-evaluate the fair value of these companies, as they all undergo their boring bureaucratic meetings with their policy advisor ""experts"". This led to a spike in the Russell 2000, initially thought of as a rotation out of big tech to ""value"", but actually it was due to a small pump causing short sellers to move out of these positions, leading to a transitory pump in the Russell 2k, that has now passed. The CrowdStrike saga has seen only a small correction in these lofty tech valuations. However, the VIX has now pumped, after a LONG time. VIX, as you will know, measures the forward looking 30 day options trades. This might be expected going into earnings, but has not been the case for the last two quarters. Tech will likely meet, or even beat their expectations. But expect volatility and expect declines. Markets hate uncertainty, and the Democrats are in turmoil. During the sell-off yesterday, one stock in particular did well. That was ARM, up 3% after a huge 20+ dollar decline in the prior few days. It is likely short positions are being taken in the most over-valued of the current tech stocks.

,"In 1906, what began as a modest correction from all-time highs in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, led to liquidity drying up, straining financial systems and causing a huge sell-off and liquidity crunch. The Dow Jones plummeted as much as 50% in the following year! (granted, markets were less liquid as they are today). The DowJones was the key index back in the industrial era, which has been replaced by the NASDAQ 100. Currently, we have been at ATHs in the S&P500 and the NASDAQ, with big tech leading the charge. This has led to very high, expensive (PE ratio) valuations. The Republicans have begun the shakiness, leading hedge funds and institutions to re-evaluate the fair value of these companies, as they all undergo their boring bureaucratic meetings with their policy advisor ""experts"". This led to a spike in the Russell 2000, initially thought of as a rotation out of big tech to ""value"", but actually it was due to a small pump causing short sellers to move out of these positions, leading to a transitory pump in the Russell 2k, that has now passed. The CrowdStrike saga has seen only a small correction in these lofty tech valuations. However, the VIX has now pumped, after a LONG time. VIX, as you will know, measures the forward looking 30 day options trades. This might be expected going into earnings, but has not been the case for the last two quarters. Tech will likely meet, or even beat their expectations. But expect volatility and expect declines. Markets hate uncertainty, and the Democrats are in turmoil.
