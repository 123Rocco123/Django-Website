,"I'm going to start this with a really simple question: Why in the ever-loving hell would you hold Arm over Nvidia? ARM's P/S is 45. Their growth is absolute trash for the valuation. They make no real profit and their margin sucks. Apple has raked them over the coals so bad that Masayoshi 'WeWork bagholder' Son had to beg Tim Apple for years to pay ARM more. Meanwhile, NVDA is growing like 20% CAGR every quarter. They're literally printing profit. EPS is up like 550% yoy. And the P/S of the company is.... 33. Don't even get me started on how the numbers look if we look at just the last quarter and the projections... The obvious answer here is go short ARM and long NVDA and just completely ignore macro events as your cool long-short portfolio mints money. But the hero of our story can't quite do that; Enter Masayoshi 'not even the Saudis want to lend me money anymore and they own most of the shittiest stock on earth: Lucid' Son. He owns 90% of ARM. Now back to the original question; Why should he keep basically anything at all in this stock even if he's the ultimate AI bull? You can just... buy NVDA instead and get a much better company for very significantly cheaper. I'm willing to bet that he won't hold nearly as much as people expect. It's so hilariously overvalued he's gonna be dumping this trash as quick as he can find liquidity. Hell, he was willing to IPO it for $50 just 6 months ago and you're telling me he's not gonna take profit at $130? In the previous threads about the topic there's been a lot of 'he's not gonna crash the stock bro he's gonna sell it slowly bro'. How do you liquididate 90% of a company slowly??? If he 'liquidates slowly' he's gonna be liquidating it for the next 2 years. And even though Softbank's recent quarters have been good, Son's raked up so many losses that he apparently personally owes $5 billion to his own company. Now, let me be pretty clear here; this shit (probably) won't gap down like 15% this week unless something goes wrong on the macro end with the CPI print. Over the next year? Maybe, but the problem is everyone knows this stock is trash and the options are criminally expensive. But you know when they aren't too expensive? Right before next earnings. It gives you a cool 5ish weeks for this to play out and see how the market responds to some serious selling pressure and a potential turn in the macro picture. If nothing else, it's a relatively cheap hedge for your over-leveraged tech positions. Positions: IMPORTANT NOTE: I've got an order set to sell puts at $80 for $2 a pop to make it a spread that you can't see here. I'm not really here to gamble this is just the shittiest stock with the best catalyst for the next few weeks. I'm personally hoping those fill eventually and then I'll just ride it out. If not, I might take profit if IV increasing causes a pop and the macro picture is looking better than I expect. https://imgur.com/a/sMBSKgU",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

The price might move bigly but I doubt it’ll be because they dumped - it’s probably going to get shorted to hell but nvidia might be stepping in as a buyer hereI’m short an uncomfortable amount of vol here.

It's probably going to drop much, much lower after the dust has settled.For reference, ARM IV a year out is around 78% while Nvidia is around 50%.Why short puts? Because the IV on puts is insanely high. I've earned about 3.5% IV so far today. Up about 40k.",2,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I'm going to start this with a really simple question: Why in the ever-loving hell would you hold Arm over Nvidia? ARM's P/S is 45. Their growth is absolute trash for the valuation. They make no real profit and their margin sucks. Apple has raked them over the coals so bad that Masayoshi 'WeWork bagholder' Son had to beg Tim Apple for years to pay ARM more. Meanwhile, NVDA is growing like 20% CAGR every quarter. They're literally printing profit. EPS is up like 550% yoy. And the P/S of the company is.... 33. Don't even get me started on how the numbers look if we look at just the last quarter and the projections... The obvious answer here is go short ARM and long NVDA and just completely ignore macro events as your cool long-short portfolio mints money. But the hero of our story can't quite do that; Enter Masayoshi 'not even the Saudis want to lend me money anymore and they own most of the shittiest stock on earth: Lucid' Son. He owns 90% of ARM. Now back to the original question; Why should he keep basically anything at all in this stock even if he's the ultimate AI bull? You can just... buy NVDA instead and get a much better company for very significantly cheaper. I'm willing to bet that he won't hold nearly as much as people expect. It's so hilariously overvalued he's gonna be dumping this trash as quick as he can find liquidity. Hell, he was willing to IPO it for $50 just 6 months ago and you're telling me he's not gonna take profit at $130? In the previous threads about the topic there's been a lot of 'he's not gonna crash the stock bro he's gonna sell it slowly bro'. How do you liquididate 90% of a company slowly??? If he 'liquidates slowly' he's gonna be liquidating it for the next 2 years. And even though Softbank's recent quarters have been good, Son's raked up so many losses that he apparently personally owes $5 billion to his own company. Now, let me be pretty clear here; this shit (probably) won't gap down like 15% this week unless something goes wrong on the macro end with the CPI print. Over the next year? Maybe, but the problem is everyone knows this stock is trash and the options are criminally expensive. But you know when they aren't too expensive? Right before next earnings. It gives you a cool 5ish weeks for this to play out and see how the market responds to some serious selling pressure and a potential turn in the macro picture. If nothing else, it's a relatively cheap hedge for your over-leveraged tech positions.

,"I'm going to start this with a really simple question: Why in the ever-loving hell would you hold Arm over Nvidia? ARM's P/S is 45. Their growth is absolute trash for the valuation.

You can just... buy NVDA instead and get a much better company for very significantly cheaper. I'm willing to bet that he won't hold nearly as much as people expect.

I'm not really here to gamble this is just the shittiest stock with the best catalyst for the next few weeks. I'm personally hoping those fill eventually and then I'll just ride it out.

,"I'm going to start this with a really simple question: Why in the ever-loving hell would you hold Arm over Nvidia? ARM's P/S is 45. Their growth is absolute trash for the valuation. They make no real profit and their margin sucks. Apple has raked them over the coals so bad that Masayoshi 'WeWork bagholder' Son had to beg Tim Apple for years to pay ARM more. Meanwhile, NVDA is growing like 20% CAGR every quarter. They're literally printing profit. EPS is up like 550% yoy. And the P/S of the company is.... 33. Don't even get me started on how the numbers look if we look at just the last quarter and the projections... The obvious answer here is go short ARM and long NVDA and just completely ignore macro events as your cool long-short portfolio mints money. But the hero of our story can't quite do that; Enter Masayoshi 'not even the Saudis want to lend me money anymore and they own most of the shittiest stock on earth: Lucid' Son. He owns 90% of ARM. Now back to the original question; Why should he keep basically anything at all in this stock even if he's the ultimate AI bull? You can just... buy NVDA instead and get a much better company for very significantly cheaper. I'm willing to bet that he won't hold nearly as much as people expect. It's so hilariously overvalued he's gonna be dumping this trash as quick as he can find liquidity. Hell, he was willing to IPO it for $50 just 6 months ago and you're telling me he's not gonna take profit at $130? In the previous threads about the topic there's been a lot of 'he's not gonna crash the stock bro he's gonna sell it slowly bro'. How do you liquididate 90% of a company slowly??? If he 'liquidates slowly' he's gonna be liquidating it for the next 2 years. And even though Softbank's recent quarters have been good, Son's raked up so many losses that he apparently personally owes $5 billion to his own company. Now, let me be pretty clear here; this shit (probably) won't gap down like 15% this week unless something goes wrong on the macro end with the CPI print. Over the next year? Maybe, but the problem is everyone knows this stock is trash and the options are criminally expensive. But you know when they aren't too expensive? Right before next earnings. It gives you a cool 5ish weeks for this to play out and see how the market responds to some serious selling pressure and a potential turn in the macro picture.
