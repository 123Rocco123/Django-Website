He didn't succumb to FOMO or the need for single day insane gains. He just took a long position with options, rolled effectively, and continued forward.Because lets be honest, will GPUs continue to be in demand? Yes. For mining (bitcoin at 52k) and AI (OpenAI is showcasing insane video tech), and these are just what the private sector shows us, not the tech that literally will change our entire society.
