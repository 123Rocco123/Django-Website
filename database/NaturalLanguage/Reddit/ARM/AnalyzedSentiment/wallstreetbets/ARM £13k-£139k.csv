,Good day at the office,"Be careful. Soft Bank still owns 90% of ARM. They are a bank. They are going to be a seller. If they sell just 15% of their position, that is greater than the entire public float.I agree that ARM is a great long term position. But in the short term the stock price is controlled by what Soft Bank decides to do.",1,0.551,0.996,NEGATIVE
,Good day at the office,they cant sell until march,2,0.505,0.692,NEGATIVE
,Good day at the office,Good to know. Thanks.,3,0.555,0.991,POSITIVE
,Good day at the office,180 days from the September 14 IPO. I calculate that the restriction ends March 12 ‚Äî since February has 29 days this year.I like ARM but will probably wait to buy more shares until a few days after the restriction expires.,3,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Good day at the office,Thing is they can but why? Why sell at 150$ let‚Äôs say when you could at possibly 250$. There stock had a nice bounce from this today as well. I don‚Äôt think them liquidating shares would benefit them as much as holding imho.,2,0.541,0.986,NEGATIVE
,Good day at the office,They are a bank. They own 90% of a company that is worth more than all the rest of the bank put together. Banks are all about diversifying and managing risk. I don‚Äôt think there is any doubt that Sift Bank is a seller. The only questions is how much and when and whether they sell into the small public market or cut private deals.,3,0.553,0.984,POSITIVE
,Good day at the office,They are not a bank lol. SoftBank is masayoshi sons robinhood account,4,0.515,0.963,NEGATIVE

,Good day at the office,SOFT BANK owns like 90 percent of the shares.. lock up ends mid march. Why not buy the time?whole reason i bought calls.. was the soft bank lockup. It'lll be the whole reason i buy puts.,2,0.536,0.998,NEGATIVE
,Good day at the office,Good point. I wonder how many employees have stock or options that will cash out in March. Do you think Softbank will sell a good chunk of their shares?,3,0.54,0.551,NEGATIVE
,Good day at the office,soft bank was an anchor investor i believe.. they have 90% of all shares. Whats funny is soft bank valuation is lower than ARMS. Ask yourself why? if softbank owns 80 percent of arm... why would its valuation be less than that of ARM.We are witness a nice china pump and dump.,4,0.52,0.986,NEGATIVE
