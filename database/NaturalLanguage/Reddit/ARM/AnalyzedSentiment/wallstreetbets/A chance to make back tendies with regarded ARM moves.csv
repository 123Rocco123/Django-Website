,"PE Ratio is a nice 1,580.00, Arm's calendar Q4 (FY Q3) revenue was up 28% yoy at $746 million for EBITDA of $450 million. Market Cap sits at a cool 129.949B now. In short these numbers are horrendous and make NVDA, SMCI look like bargains. ARM holdings is probably one of the most volatile companies at its current market cap. Should be public knowledge that Softbank is able to dump a shit ton of shares starting around mid March and it's likely going to tank following that. Maybe it's going to pull a CAVA, you never now, but shit it not going to be worth the hold to find out. Anyway that's still about a month away. So why is it doing this stupid shit? Two reasons. One reason is that the 90% of the shares that Softbank owns are currently locked up and can't be sold. So out of that 129.949B 90% are locked up, that leaves us with 12.9B or 102 million shares at current prices. Nvidia just reported a 1.96M share stake in ARM, so you can make that a cool round 100 million shares. A few more institutional investors and the float of shares that can be freely traded by us regards gets into the xx million shares. Quoting reuter's: The question now is what SoftBank, which is currently restricted from selling Arm shares as part of its agreement to take the company public, does in March, when it’s permitted to begin selling Arm shares again.

The logical thing would be some kind of ultra regarded move into 200+ followed by a crash/fade into the March lockup expiry.

Two reasons. One reason is that the 90% of the shares that Softbank owns are currently locked up and can't be sold. So out of that 129.949B 90% are locked up, that leaves us with 12.9B or 102 million shares at current prices. Nvidia just reported a 1.96M share stake in ARM, so you can make that a cool round 100 million shares. A few more institutional investors and the float of shares that can be freely traded by us regards gets into the xx million shares.The lockup is for early shareholders and employees of existing RSU's (restricted stock units).It has nothing to do with the 90% of the stake softbank owns in the company. Why the fuck would they just dump shares out onto the market suddenly right after a lockup expiry? It's makes absolutely no sense. They could do it but I hardly find that date an appropriate time to even think of such a dumbass thing.More than likely they would do it if they needed to raise some capital and they absolutely know ARM is in a great position itself. Like 2 more quarters of just great growth and then yea I could see them saying ok if we NEED to raise money we have this option. And it wouldn't be a day dump but probably over a year or so on listed dates. Meaning, they would do it so the market could absorb it appropriately.Next, RSU's don't just sell into the market but rather ""transfer"" to the employees ownership. They go from being the companies to being the employees.They simply endup in a brokerage account.Now, unlike Palantir or perhaps like Palantir as it remains to be seen. If the employees value their company they most likely will simply let the shares just sit there. For example I exercise my RSU's but i've never actually sold out of anything and cashed in.Now, each company is obviously different. And this is a first time large windfall so to be fair it could be more impactful this time. As well, even if you don't want to sell your RSU's you might want to sell some to cover the tax burden.But point is. If you believe your company is cooking with a hot stock and you KNOW internally there is more on the table coming. It may be telling if there is NOT a big hit on that day or thereafter.Also, the timing of the call market. Palantir has proven to sell when the stock goes up a lot. Again, each company and culture is different. I can't really speak to ARMs.However, one last thing to consider. The lockup ends on the 12th. The call date is the 15th. Now, I don't know if you're imaging a boiler room situation but like I said, a person would have to call actively release the RSU's and then call their brokerage and do something.Again, if you're not worried about it you may just sit there for weeks and not do anything. Years. You may do the transfer and just again not do anything. So the idea that by the 15th there is going to be a massive sell-off is just silly. it may not really be much.I'm thinking about selling puts here if this is the mindset that people have about an RSU lockup period confabulated with softbanks outstanding ownership.",0,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE

One reason is that the 90% of the shares that Softbank owns are currently locked up and can't be sold. So out of that 129.949B 90% are locked up, that leaves us with 12.9B or 102 million shares at current prices.
