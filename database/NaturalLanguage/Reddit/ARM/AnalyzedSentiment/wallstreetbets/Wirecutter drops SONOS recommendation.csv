Lenbrook / NAD / Bluesound is where I’m going.I can’t see them getting that credibility back any time soon.",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

I believe connectivity has been slightly spottier lately, but nothing that resetting the wifi connection occasionally from my mobile cannot fix and those problems existed before the new app. I will not be purchasing new Sonos products however as I have no need for them currently and will hold off on investing in their ecosystem further as I believe there is a potential for bankruptcy here given the current state of their business, but I do think the user base's issues are a bit overblown.",1,0.545,0.977,NEGATIVE

The only course of action I have been given is to do a factory reset on all devices and see if it corrects the issue. I am seriously considering just putting my system on eBay and moving to another manufacturer.,2,0.511,1.0,NEGATIVE

Good ones will last a century. Then buy an amplifier which you replace every 5-10 years.,1,0.538,0.985,POSITIVE
