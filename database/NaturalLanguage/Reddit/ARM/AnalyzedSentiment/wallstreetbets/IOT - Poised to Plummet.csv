The classic is:You set up a 10b5-1 plan to automatically sell some stock in chunks over time, say at the end of each quarter. Each quarter, you review your companyâ€™s results before you make them public. If theyâ€™re bad, you just nod silently and let the 10b5-1 plan dump stock. If theyâ€™re great, you cancel your 10b5-1 plan. Itâ€™s not insider trading because youâ€™re not trading! And then later you start a new one.This is not legal advice, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has in recent years written rules to crack down on the obvious 10b5-1 abuses.So there is still good opportunity for insiders to game the system, is it?i.e. Set advance schedule for 'Sell' tx to happen before every Q result, and only in those quarters where results are gonna be great, opportunistically, (tell the broker to) cancel those transactions just before the schedule date.
