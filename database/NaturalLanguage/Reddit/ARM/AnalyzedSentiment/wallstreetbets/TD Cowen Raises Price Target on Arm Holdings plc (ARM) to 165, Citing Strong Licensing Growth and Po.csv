,link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/td-cowen-raises-price-target-004221082.html who still bullish on arm here? china worries or nah?,ARM's killing it with licensing growth rn. TD Cowen just raised their PT to $165 with high-20% YoY licensing growth expected for FY25. China exposure isn't even the main story anymore - this is all about AI and edge computing gains. Their v9 architecture straight up doubles royalty rates vs old v8. Plus they got 20M+ software devs locked into their ecosystem. That's fucking massive. Smartphone market's kinda meh but AI chips gonna print hard.Long ARM. This shit's gonna run.,0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.999

The licensing growth is actually hitting high-20s, and that's just the start. Their v9 architecture literally doubles the royalty rates compared to v8. Plus they've got the largest compute ecosystem with 20M+ devs - that's a moat that's basically impossible to compete with. PE ratios don't tell the whole story when you're dealing with a company that's positioned to dominate AI chip architecture. Their edge computing play is gonna be huge as more devices need AI processing. This isn't some regular semiconductor play - ARM's basically gonna be in every AI-capable device going forward. The growth trajectory is way steeper than what current numbers suggest.",2,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.895

What is ARM going to dominate exactly?Grace CPU is ARM based, which has stiff competition from x86 - making it ancillary, not the dominating force. That's still a lot of revenue potential, but far from dominating the landscape.Edge computing is a nice growth opportunity, but we've yet to see growth there take off.
