,"Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. Background: In late September 2020, Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was ~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the FTC sues to block the merger citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on ARM architecture and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.

However, in the near term the stock price has everything to do with when SoftBank decides to reduce its 90% stake (and by how much).SoftBank certainly will sell some amount of its shares. If it were to sell just one ninth of its position quickly in the public market, the ARM stock price would be cut in half. More likely, SoftBank will try not to disrupt the current value of the stock too much and will sell over a period of months — effectively capping the price of the stock for the foreseeable future.",3,0.574,0.999,NEGATIVE

I would recommend you don’t do this.They don’t have a broad or long term strategy to improve their AI or build other innovations either. Their AI and tech are only improved if one of their non-tech customers agrees to a substantial ($10-20mm minimum) contract for a specific use case.Notably most of these customers are the older companies in the F500. IBM does not have any growth plan other than for the oldest portion of the economy to grow. Their project minimums mean they have no substantial young, growing customers. Their lack of tech leadership means they have nothing to sell to large tech companies.There is a reason they have been laying off <500 staff per office or department every single time they make an announcement in the news. It’s to cover up the decline. There’s a reason they don’t have a single significant data offering in the market. After running one of the largest DB businesses on the planet for years they missed the boat on doc DBs, columnar storage, vector DBs, and they’re a year behing Google Cloud at having a scalable cloud offering for RAG. …unless one of their non-tech customers asks for and funds an AI project they won’t innovate one internally. Even then IBM will likely just try to acquire a not-healthy startup or open source one. And why would one of their non-tech customers even know to ask for a vector DB or RAG option until they’re available at near-cost from OpenAI?IBM is deep into decline.

If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright.

In December 2021, the FTC sues to block the merger citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on ARM architecture and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall.

,"Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. Background: In late September 2020, Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was ~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the FTC sues to block the merger citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on ARM architecture and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall.
